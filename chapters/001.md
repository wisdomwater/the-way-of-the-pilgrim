## Chapter 1

By the grace of God, I am a Christian.
By my actions, I am a great sinner.
And by calling, I am a wandering pilgrim —
A simple soul without a home, traveling from place to place.

All I carry with me is a small knapsack slung over my shoulder with a little dried bread inside,
and tucked close to my heart, a copy of the Holy Bible.

That’s all I have.
And really, that’s all I need.

One Sunday — it was the twenty-fourth after Pentecost — I went to church for the Divine Liturgy. During the reading from Saint Paul’s First Letter to the Thessalonians, a single phrase struck me like a bell in the quiet of my soul:

“Pray without ceasing.”

I couldn’t shake it. The words clung to me long after the service was over.

How could that even be possible? I wondered. We all have responsibilities — work, daily tasks, conversations. How could someone truly *pray without ceasing*? Was that even realistic?

Later, I turned to the Scriptures myself. And sure enough, there it was again, clear as day:

* *“Pray without ceasing”* (1 Thess. 5:17)
* *“Pray at all times in the Spirit”* (Eph. 6:18)
* *“In every place lift up holy hands in prayer”* (1 Tim. 2:8)

The more I thought about it, the more troubled I became. What did this mean for me? What kind of prayer was this? And how could I possibly live it?

I knew I needed help.
*Someone must understand this kind of prayer*, I thought. *Surely a wise teacher or priest can explain it to me.*

So I began to travel. I visited churches known for their gifted preachers, hoping I might finally learn the way of unceasing prayer.

I heard many wonderful sermons — thoughtful, passionate, full of wisdom. They spoke about the beauty of prayer, its importance, and the blessings it brings. But still... no one explained *how* to actually do it. No one could tell me how to enter into prayer that flows without end. Not one sermon taught me how to pray in the Spirit or how to make my whole life into a prayer.

And so my longing only deepened.

After hearing so many sermons without finding the answer my soul longed for, I finally gave up on those kinds of talks. They were fine for the general crowd — helpful, even inspiring — but they never touched on *how* to actually pray without ceasing.

And now, something inside me wouldn’t let go of this longing. It had taken root in me. I felt drawn — irresistibly — to discover the way. So with God’s help, I made up my mind: I would seek out someone with real experience, someone who had lived this kind of prayer and could show me the way.

I set off again, wandering from place to place, my Bible my constant companion. Wherever I went, I asked if anyone knew of a spiritual guide — someone who could teach the inner life, not just talk about it.

Eventually, I heard of a certain landowner who lived quietly in a nearby village. They said he had spent many years devoted to his salvation. He never left his home, had a small chapel in his house, and spent his days in prayer and reading spiritual writings.

When I heard this, I didn’t waste any time. I picked up my pace and hurried to find him.

When I arrived, I found the man just as described — quiet, peaceful, reserved. He looked at me kindly and asked, “What is it you want from me?”

“I’ve heard,” I said, “that you are a man of prayer and spiritual insight. In the name of God, would you please help me understand something? What does the Apostle mean when he says, *‘Pray without ceasing’?* How can a person possibly pray like that? I want to learn, but I just can’t grasp it on my own.”

He paused for a moment and studied me carefully. Then he said:

*“Unceasing interior prayer is the continual movement of the soul toward God. To grow into this beautiful practice, you must ask the Lord often — with all your heart — to teach you how to pray without ceasing. Just begin. Pray more and more earnestly, and in time, the prayer itself will teach you how to continue. But it will unfold in its own time.”*

That was all he said.

Then he gave me something to eat, kindly pressed a little money into my hand for the road, and sent me on my way.

And just like that — I was off again.
No real explanation. No step-by-step guide.
Still hungry for something I didn’t yet know how to find.

And so, I set off once more.
All the while, my thoughts turned again and again to the words that kind landowner had spoken. I reread Scripture. I pondered. I prayed. But still... I couldn’t quite understand what he meant.

The longing in me had only grown stronger. It gnawed at me. Some nights, it even kept me from sleep. My heart was restless — not with anxiety, but with a deep ache to know God more fully through this mysterious, unceasing prayer.

After walking about 125 miles, I came to a large provincial town. There, I noticed a monastery on the outskirts. As I settled into an inn nearby, I overheard someone speaking warmly about the abbot of that monastery — a gracious man, known for his kindness, his hospitality, and his life of prayer.

That was enough for me. I went to find him.

He welcomed me with open arms — warm, gentle, joyful. He sat me down, offered me something to eat, and made me feel at home.

“Holy Father,” I said, “I’m not here for food — thank you kindly — but for guidance. I need help. I want to know what I must do to be saved.”

He looked at me with a soft smile.
“Well, dear one,” he said, “live according to the commandments, pray to God, and you will be saved!”

“Yes, Father... but I’ve heard we are to *pray without ceasing*. And that’s where I get lost. I don’t understand how to do that. I don’t even fully understand what it means. Would you help me?”

He paused for a moment, then said, “Ah... that, I’m not so sure I can explain. But wait — I do have a small book that might help.”

He went to his bookshelf and returned with a little volume: *The Spiritual Education of the Interior Man* by Saint Dimitri. He opened it and handed it to me. “Here, read this part.”

I took the book and read the passage:

> *‘Those words of the Apostle — “pray without ceasing” — should be understood as referring to the prayer of the mind: for the mind can always be turned toward God, and pray to Him without stopping.’*

I looked up. “But Father, how? How can the mind be always turned toward God — praying without being distracted by everything else in life?”

He sighed gently and replied, “Ah, dear brother... that takes a great deal of wisdom — unless, of course, God chooses to grant it as a gift.”

That was all he said.

No further guidance, no steps, no clarity. Just a mystery left in my hands.

I spent the night at the monastery, quietly grateful for his kindness. And in the morning, I thanked him for the shelter and continued on my way — still not knowing where, exactly, I was going. Only that something inside me was drawing me forward.

I felt a quiet sorrow rising within me — a grief that came from not understanding what my soul so deeply longed to grasp. Still, I tried to comfort myself by reading the Holy Scriptures. They were my food, my compass, my companion.

For five days, I walked along the main road, lost in thought, clinging to my little Bible like a lifeline. I didn’t know where I was going exactly. I only knew that something was calling me onward.

One evening, just as the light began to fade, an old man caught up with me on the road. He looked like a cleric of some kind, so I asked who he was. With a peaceful smile, he told me he was a *schima monk* — a monastic who had taken the Great Schema, the highest level of Orthodox monastic vows — and that he lived in a monastery about six miles off the road.

“You should come with me,” he said kindly. “We welcome pilgrims at the monastery. There’s a guesthouse where you can rest and eat with other devout travelers.”

I hesitated. My journey wasn’t about food or rest.

“Thank you,” I said, “but my peace doesn’t depend on finding shelter. What I truly need is spiritual guidance. As for food, I’ve got some dry crusts of bread in my knapsack — enough to get by.”

The monk paused and looked at me with interest. “What kind of guidance are you looking for, brother? What is it that’s troubling your heart?”

His voice was gentle, sincere. Something in me softened.

He continued, “Come with me. We have experienced *startsi* — wise elders — at our monastery. They can nourish your soul and help you find the path, through the Word of God and the teachings of the holy Fathers.”

So I told him my story.

“Batyushka,” I began, “about a year ago, during the Divine Liturgy, I heard a reading from the Apostle that stirred something deep in me. It said, *‘Pray without ceasing.’* I couldn’t make sense of it. So I began reading the Bible myself, and there I found it repeated again and again: we are to pray always, in every place, at all times — not only while working, or walking, or reading, but even while we sleep. *‘I sleep, but my heart is awake’* — that’s what it says in the Song of Songs.

“I couldn’t understand it. How could a person possibly pray in this way? How could this be done? What kind of prayer was this?

“That question took root in me. I couldn’t let it go. Day and night, I found myself thinking about it, searching for answers.

“I started visiting churches wherever I could, hoping to hear a sermon that might explain it. And I heard many fine words — teachings about how to prepare for prayer, about the blessings that come from prayer — but never anything about how to actually *pray without ceasing*. No one could show me what that prayer looked like, or how it lived and breathed in a person’s life.

“I kept reading the Bible to see if I had misunderstood. But still, no answers came. My heart remains restless. I am not at peace. I’m still searching.”

The starets made the sign of the cross and began to speak.

“Thank God, dear brother,” he said, “for placing within you this deep and irresistible longing for unceasing, interior prayer. This desire didn’t come from nowhere — it is a gift. It is the very call of God stirring in your soul.

“So be at peace. Truly — rest in this: up to now, what you’ve been experiencing is the testing of your will, a kind of preparation. You’ve been cooperating with the Spirit’s gentle invitation, learning to follow that inner tug toward something greater than yourself.

“And now, you’ve been shown something essential — something that can’t be learned from books or sermons alone. You’ve come to see that no amount of worldly knowledge, no clever reasoning or surface-level curiosity, can open the way to the mystery of unceasing prayer. That kind of prayer is not the result of intellect — it’s the fruit of a humble and quiet heart. It is born out of poverty of spirit, not brilliance of mind. It must be *lived*, not simply studied.

“So no, it’s not surprising that the sermons you’ve heard haven’t satisfied your hunger. They may have been wise and well-meaning, but they were focused on the *surroundings* of prayer — not its essence.

“It’s true: much is said and written about prayer. But even among spiritual teachers, many are more skilled at discussing the outer elements of prayer than at describing its living core. Most speak from ideas, not experience.

“One preacher might offer a beautiful message about why prayer is necessary. Another might describe the power of prayer — its benefits, its fruits. Yet another will explain how to prepare for it: how to focus your mind, warm your heart, be attentive, humble, contrite, and so on.

“All of this has value. But none of it quite gets to the heart of the matter: *what prayer itself actually is*, and *how to learn to pray unceasingly*.

“And that — that is the most important question of all. The one question that rarely receives a clear answer.

“Why? Because it requires more than reason. It requires a kind of vision, a mystical insight that comes from the Spirit — not from intellectual effort. That kind of insight is rare. And in its absence, many well-meaning people end up treating prayer backwards.

“They think that if they just prepare well enough — with effort, focus, virtue, good works — then prayer will somehow emerge from all that. But it doesn’t work that way.

“It is *prayer* itself that gives birth to those good works. It is prayer that awakens humility, tenderness, and love. Not the other way around.

“When we treat the fruits of prayer as if they’re the cause — when we try to make them the *starting point* instead of the *result* — we unintentionally strip prayer of its real power.”

“All of this,” the starets continued, “runs contrary to the witness of Holy Scripture. The Apostle Paul himself says:

> *‘I urge, therefore, that first of all, supplications be made...’*
> (1 Timothy 2:1)

Did you catch that? *First of all*. Before anything else, *pray.*

It’s clear, isn’t it? Prayer isn’t just one part of the Christian life — it is the starting point, the foundation. A lot of good works are asked of us, yes — acts of charity, humility, self-control. But *none of those* can truly take root unless prayer comes first.

Without prayer, how can we even begin to approach God?
How can we discover truth?
How can we overcome the cravings and urges of the flesh, or open our hearts to the light of Christ?

Only prayer makes this possible — and not just any prayer, but frequent, sincere prayer.

Now, don’t misunderstand me. The kind of pure, unceasing prayer that the soul longs for — that’s not something we can just *will* into existence. Even Saint Paul admits:

> *‘We do not know how to pray as we ought.’*
> (Romans 8:26)

So what can we do?

We can show up.
We can pray often.
We can make space — again and again — for God to teach us.

That’s the part that lies within our power: the frequency of prayer, and our willingness to return to it. That steady rhythm of prayer is what gradually prepares the soul. It softens the heart, clears the mind, and allows true prayer to take root.

And once that happens... everything else begins to unfold.

As Saint Isaac the Syrian said:

> *‘Acquire the mother, and she will bear you children.’*

In other words, *learn to pray first* — and from that prayer will flow all the virtues, all the good works, all the love and clarity the soul needs.

But this can be hard for people to see — especially those who’ve never had a living experience of prayer for themselves. Without that personal encounter, even spiritual teachers may overlook the mystical wisdom of the Fathers. And so they speak little of it.

But those who’ve tasted it, even just a little... they know. Prayer is the doorway. It is the wellspring. Everything begins there.

We became so absorbed in our conversation that, before I realized it, we had nearly reached the monastery. I didn’t want to lose the chance to learn from this wise starets, so I quickly asked, “Honorable Father, would you be so kind as to explain to me the meaning of unceasing interior prayer? And how can one learn it? I see that you have experience and know it well.”

The starets smiled gently and invited me inside. “Come with me,” he said. “I will give you a book of the Fathers’ writings. With God’s help, it will help you understand prayer clearly and in detail.”

We entered his small cell, and he began to speak:

“Unceasing interior prayer — the Jesus Prayer — is the continual, uninterrupted calling upon the holy name of Jesus Christ. With your lips, your mind, and your heart, you call to mind His constant presence and beg His mercy, no matter what you are doing, wherever you are, at all times, and even as you sleep.

The words of this prayer are simple: ‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!’

If you make this prayer your habit, you will find great comfort in it. You’ll want to repeat it again and again until one day, it feels impossible to live without it. The prayer will begin to flow naturally, of its own accord.”

“Now, is it clear to you what unceasing prayer is?” he asked.

“Very clear, my Father!” I exclaimed joyfully. “For God’s sake, please teach me how to acquire it!”

“We can learn how to pray in this way from the book called the *Philokalia*,” he said. “It contains the complete and detailed teachings on unceasing interior prayer, given by twenty-five holy Fathers. It is so full of wisdom and grace that it is considered the foremost manual for the contemplative spiritual life.

The blessed Nikifor once said, ‘Without struggle and sweat, it does not bring one to salvation.’”

“Is it possible that it is more exalted and holier than the Bible?” I asked.

“No,” he replied, “it is not more exalted or holier than the Bible. But it contains enlightened explanations of what is mystically contained within the Scriptures. It is so lofty that it cannot be easily grasped by our limited intellects.

“Let me give you an example: the sun is the greatest, most resplendent source of light. But you cannot look directly at it with the naked eye. You need a special lens—one that is far smaller and dimmer than the sun itself—to study its brilliance and endure its fiery rays. In this way, the Holy Scriptures are like the sun, and the *Philokalia* is the necessary lens that helps us see and understand its light.

“Now listen carefully,” the starets said as he opened the *Philokalia* and selected a passage from Saint Simeon the New Theologian:

> ‘Find a quiet place to sit alone and in silence; bow your head and shut your eyes. Breathe softly, look with your mind into your heart; recollect your mind—that is, gather all its thoughts—and bring them down from your mind into your heart. As you breathe, repeat:
> “Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me” — either quietly with your lips, or only in your mind. Strive to banish all thoughts; be calm and patient, and repeat this exercise frequently.’

The starets explained all this to me patiently, illustrating with examples. We read further passages from Saint Gregory of Sinai, the blessed Callistus, and Ignatius.

After reading, the starets spoke more in his own words. I was fascinated. I listened carefully, absorbing every detail as best as I could.

We spent the entire night together, without sleeping a wink, and then went off to matins. When it was time to part, the starets blessed me and said that as I learned the prayer, I should come to him regularly — to reveal everything honestly and openly, to confess my struggles. He told me it was difficult, even futile, to live an inner spiritual life properly without the guidance of a spiritual director.

Standing in the church, I felt a burning zeal inside me to learn unceasing interior prayer as diligently as I could. I prayed to God for help in this effort.

But then a question troubled me: How would I visit the starets for counsel and confession? The monastery guesthouse allowed only a three-day stay, and there were no other residences nearby.

Then, by God’s grace, I heard about a village a little over three miles away. I went there searching for a place to stay, and I was overjoyed to find lodging. A kindly peasant hired me to guard his kitchen garden for the summer, and in return, I could live alone in a small hut near the garden. Thank God! I had found peaceful shelter.

So, I settled into my new home and began to learn interior prayer as I had been taught, visiting the starets from time to time.

For a week, in the quiet of the garden, I worked diligently on unceasing prayer. At first, it seemed like progress was being made. But then a heavy weight settled over me — laziness, boredom, drowsiness, and a swarm of distracting thoughts clouded my mind.

Filled with grief, I went back to the starets and shared my troubles.

He greeted me kindly and said, “That, beloved brother, is the kingdom of darkness waging war against you. There is nothing more dreadful to this darkness than the prayer of the heart, so it will try every trick to stop you from learning to pray.

“But remember — even the enemy acts only by God’s will and permission, and only as long as it is necessary for us. It seems your humility still needs testing. It is too soon for you to enter your deepest heart with such unrestrained zeal, lest you fall into spiritual greed.

“I will read to you what the *Philokalia* says about this.”

The starets found a passage from the teachings of Blessed Nicephorus the Solitary and began to read:

> *“If, after a few attempts, you are unable to enter into the place of the heart, as you were taught to do, then do what I tell you, and with God’s help, you will find what you seek. You know that each person has a larynx through which they speak. Banishing all thoughts (which you can do if you truly want), exercise this faculty and continually repeat the following: ‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!’ Compel yourself always to repeat this. If you do this for some time, then assuredly this exercise will open the doors of your heart. Experience has proven this.”*

“So this is what the holy Fathers prescribe in such cases,” the starets said. “You must accept this teaching with complete trust and repeat the Jesus Prayer as often as possible.

“Take this *chotki* and use it while you pray. Begin by repeating the prayer at least three thousand times a day. Whether standing, sitting, walking, or lying down, continue to say, ‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!’

“Do not rush or say it loudly, but without fail, repeat it three thousand times each day. Don’t increase or decrease this number on your own.

“Through this practice, God will help you attain the unceasing prayer of the heart.”

I joyfully accepted his instructions, returned home, and began to follow the starets’ guidance faithfully and exactly.

For two days, the prayer felt difficult and forced. But then, gradually, it became easy and deeply desirable. When I stopped, I felt a compelling need to begin again.

Soon, I was praying with comfort and ease, without the effort I had to exert at first.

I shared all this with the starets, who then instructed me to increase the number of repetitions to six thousand times a day. “Be calm and simply try to repeat the prayer as faithfully as you can, for the number of times I have assigned you. God will bestow His mercy on you.”

For an entire week, in the solitude of my hut, I repeated the Jesus Prayer six thousand times a day. I didn’t worry about anything, and I paid no attention to any thoughts, no matter how strongly they assailed me. I focused solely on precisely carrying out the starets’s instructions.

And do you know what happened? I became so used to the prayer that when I stopped, even for a brief moment, I felt as though something was missing — as if I had lost something precious. When I began again, I was immediately filled with an inner lightness and joy.

If I happened to meet people, I no longer felt any desire to speak with them; I longed only for solitude, to be alone with my prayer. Within a week, I had become deeply accustomed to this prayer.

After ten days without seeing me, the starets himself came to visit. I described my inner state to him. He listened and said, “Now that you have grown accustomed to the prayer, take care to preserve and strengthen this habit. Do not waste your time, and with God’s help, resolve to repeat the prayer, without fail, twelve thousand times a day.

Remain in solitude, rise earlier in the morning, stay up later at night, and come to me for counsel every two weeks.”

I began to follow the starets’s instructions. By late evening on the first day, I had barely managed to complete the rule of twelve thousand repetitions. On the second day, I fulfilled the rule with ease and delight.

At first, I was weary from the constant repetition. My tongue grew numb, and my jaws felt stiff — though these sensations were not unpleasant. Then I felt a subtle, delicate pain in the roof of my mouth, followed by a slight pain in the thumb of my left hand, which I used to count the knots of the *chotki*. My left wrist felt inflamed, and this sensation spread up to my elbow, creating a most pleasant feeling.

Moreover, all of this somehow urged and compelled me to pray more and more.

Thus, for the first five days, I faithfully repeated the prayer twelve thousand times a day. As this habit grew stronger, it also became more pleasant, and I found myself more willing to practice it.

Early one morning, something unusual happened — the prayer itself awakened me. I began to say my usual morning prayers, but my tongue felt reluctant to speak them. All my desire seemed to be reaching, almost with a will of its own, toward the Jesus Prayer.

As soon as I began to repeat it, I was filled with such lightness and joy that it felt like my tongue and mouth were moving on their own. The words flowed without any effort at all. I spent the whole day wrapped in that joy, as if I were somehow apart from the world — almost like I was on another planet.

By early evening, I had easily completed the twelve thousand repetitions of the prayer. I even had a strong desire to keep going, but I didn’t dare go beyond the rule the starets had given me. In the days that followed, I continued to call on the name of Jesus Christ with such ease, feeling drawn to it again and again.

Eventually, I went to visit the starets and told him everything in detail. He listened attentively and said, “Thank God that the ease and desire for prayer have awakened in you. This is a natural result of frequent practice and perseverance. It’s like a piece of machinery that, once its main drive is set in motion, can run on its own for a long time — but it still needs to be oiled and kept in motion from time to time.

“Do you see now what great potential God, in His love, has placed even in our earthly and sensual human nature? What deep experiences can be felt even outside a state of full grace — even in a soul still wounded by sin and passion — as you yourself have discovered?

“But how much more magnificent, delightful, and joyful it is when the Lord purifies the soul and grants the gift of unceasing, self-acting prayer! That kind of prayer is beyond words. It is a foretaste of heaven itself, given here on earth to those who seek the Lord with simplicity and love in their hearts.

“From now on, I give you leave to repeat the prayer as much as you wish, and as often as your heart desires. Strive to spend every waking moment in prayer. Don’t worry about counting repetitions anymore. Just call on the name of Jesus Christ, humbly submitting yourself to God's will, and trusting in His help.

“I believe He will not abandon you. He will guide you and set you firmly on the path.”

I embraced the starets’s guidance and spent the entire summer continually repeating the Jesus Prayer with my lips. I felt deeply at peace, and even in my dreams, I found myself still uttering the prayer.

Whenever I encountered people during the day, each one seemed so dear to me — as if they were family. Beyond that, I didn’t concern myself much with them. Thoughts faded away on their own, and the prayer alone filled my awareness. My mind stayed attentive, recollected, focused on that simple invocation. Sometimes, of its own accord, my heart would grow warm and fill with a quiet, gentle joy.

When I went to church, even the long monastic services — which used to feel burdensome — now passed swiftly, as if in no time at all. My little hut, once so plain, felt like a splendid palace. And my heart overflowed with gratitude to God for sending such a wise and holy starets to guide a wretched sinner like me.

But my time with him was not long. At the end of that summer, my beloved starets died. With tears, I said my farewell and thanked him for all the fatherly counsel he had given me. Before parting, I begged him to give me, as a blessing and keepsake, the *chotki* he had always used to pray with. He did so — and then I was alone.

Summer came to an end. The kitchen garden was harvested, and I no longer had a place to stay. The peasant released me from my duties, gave me a small wage of two rubles, and filled my knapsack with dried bread for the journey.

So once again, I set out on the road, wandering from place to place. But now, there was no worry in my wandering. Calling on the name of Jesus Christ filled my days with joy. Everyone I met seemed dear to me, as though love itself lived in each of them.


At one point, I began to wonder what I should do with the small wages I’d earned from guarding the kitchen garden. What did I really need money for? Then a thought came to me, clear and sudden: *“Of course! The starets is gone now, and there’s no one left to guide me. I’ll buy myself a copy of the Philokalia and continue learning about interior prayer on my own.”*

I made the sign of the cross and kept walking, my heart praying with each step. Eventually, I came to a provincial town and began searching through the shops for a copy of the Philokalia. I found one — but it was priced at three rubles, and I only had two.

I tried bargaining with the shopkeeper, but he wouldn’t lower the price. At last, he said, *“Go to that church over there and speak with the parish elder. He has an old copy of the book. Maybe he’ll sell it to you for two rubles.”*

So I went, and to my great joy, the elder agreed to sell me his worn old copy. It was tattered and fragile, but I was thrilled. I patched it up as best I could, sewing a piece of fabric around it for a cover, and placed it lovingly in my knapsack alongside my Bible.

I set out again, praying the Jesus Prayer with every breath. It had become more precious to me than anything else in the world. There were days I would walk over forty-seven miles, yet I felt no effort or exhaustion — the prayer filled my entire awareness.

When it was bitterly cold, I prayed more fervently, and soon warmth would return to my body. If hunger came upon me, I called on the name of Jesus, and my hunger faded away. If my back or legs ached with pain, I would lose myself in the prayer, and before long, I couldn’t even feel the discomfort.

If someone offended me, I would turn to the sweetness of the name of Jesus, and all hurt or anger would vanish, as if it had never been. It was as though I had become a fool in the eyes of the world — nothing concerned me anymore. I had no interest in the distractions and pursuits that once held sway over me. I longed only for silence, for solitude, so I could continue praying without interruption.

There was now only one desire in me: to pray unceasingly, because that prayer filled me with a quiet, enduring joy.

God alone knows what was happening to me! Of course, I understood these feelings were still bound to the senses, or, as my departed starets would say, they were a natural outcome of continual practice. And in my unworthiness and simplicity, I dared not yet reach for the deeper prayer of the inner heart. I waited instead on the will of God, placing my hope in the intercessions of my departed teacher.

And so, even though I had not yet been granted the unceasing, self-acting prayer of the heart, I still gave thanks to God — for now I understood clearly what the apostle meant when he wrote those words that first stirred my soul:

*“Pray without ceasing.”*
