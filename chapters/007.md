# Chapter 7

> “. . . pray one for another that you may be healed.” —JAMES 5:16

**Pilgrim:** “My devout traveling companion, the professor, and I could not leave without fulfilling our mutual wish to bid you a final farewell and to ask you to pray for us.”

**Professor:** “Yes, we have felt the sincerity of your heart and the redemptive conversations that brought us joy in your home and in the company of your friends. This memory will remain with us always, a pledge of communion and Christian love, even in the distant country where we are headed.”

**Starets:** “Thank you for remembering me and for your love. You have arrived at the perfect moment! There are two travelers staying with me: a Moldavian monk and a hermit who has lived in solitude in the forest for twenty years. They would like to meet you—I’ll go get them. . . .

“Here they are!”

**Pilgrim:** “Ah! How blessed is the life of a hermit! How it draws the soul wholly to union with God! The silence of the forest is like the Garden of Eden, where the sweet tree of life grows in the prayerful heart of a hermit. If only I had enough to support myself, I think I would always live as a hermit.”

**Professor:** “From a distance, everything often seems exceptionally good. Yet experience teaches that every place of advantage carries its own challenges. Of course, for those inclined toward solitude, the hermit’s life is appealing. Yet how perilous it can be! The history of asceticism shows many examples of hermits and ascetics who, having abandoned all contact with others, fell into megalomania and deep delusion.”

**Hermit:** “It amazes me how often one hears in Russia, not only in monasteries but even among devout laypeople, that anyone wishing to live as a hermit or to practice interior prayer is warned away from it for fear of falling into delusion. Those who say this usually point to examples that confirm their own way of thinking. And since they themselves avoid the interior life, they encourage others to avoid it too.

I believe this comes from either a lack of understanding and spiritual light, or from laziness when it comes to the hard work required for a life of contemplation. Sometimes it even springs from envy—when they see others who may not appear as ‘wise’ as they are, yet who might surpass them in reaching higher levels of spiritual knowledge.

It is unfortunate that such people fail to grasp what the Holy Fathers have taught on this subject. They clearly and firmly say that we must never be afraid or doubtful about calling on God. If someone does fall into self-deception or mental confusion, it is usually because of pride, or because they lacked spiritual guidance, or because they mistook certain thoughts or visions as coming from God. And even then, the Fathers say that when such temptations occur, they can lead to valuable experience and even a crown of glory, since God swiftly comes to help in such struggles. *‘Fear not, for I am with you!’* says Jesus Christ, as Saint Gregory of Sinai reminds us.

So it is pointless to avoid the inner life out of fear of delusion. A humble awareness of one’s own sins, a willingness to open the soul to a spiritual guide, and the practice of pure prayer—free from thoughts and images—these are the sure and safe protections against the delusion so many dread, and which often keeps them from a contemplative life. In fact, Saint Philotheus of Sinai goes so far as to say that those who avoid the interior life for fear of delusion are already themselves deceived. From his own experience, he writes: ‘Many monks do not recognize the delusions of their own minds by which demons torment them. They throw all their efforts into outward acts of virtue, while neglecting the mind, the inner contemplative life, because they lack enlightenment and true knowledge of it.’

Saint Gregory of Sinai confirms this as well: ‘When they hear others speak of having experienced the grace of God within themselves, they become envious and dismiss it as delusion.’”

**Professor:** “Allow me to ask this: surely anyone who pays attention to the inner life can come to a realization of their sins. But what should one do if there is no spiritual guide, no director experienced in the interior life who, once you bare your soul to him, can give reliable counsel for living it? In such a case, would it not be better to avoid the contemplative life altogether, rather than attempt it alone without guidance? … And another thing: I find it hard to understand how one can place oneself in God’s presence and yet remain entirely free of all thoughts and images. That seems unnatural, because the human mind cannot imagine anything without some shape or form. And if one is focusing on God, why not imagine Christ, or the Holy Trinity, and so on?”

**Hermit:** “The guidance of an experienced spiritual elder—a starets—to whom one can freely and trustingly open one’s soul, thoughts, and experiences each day on the path of prayer, is indeed the main condition for someone under vows who desires to practice interior prayer.

But when such a guide cannot be found, the Holy Fathers who stress the importance of guidance also grant an exception. The Venerable Nicephorus the Solitary teaches very clearly: ‘A true and knowledgeable guide is necessary for practicing the inner work of the heart. But if there is none, then one must diligently seek for one. If you cannot find one, then appeal to God with a contrite heart, asking Him to grant you instruction and guidance through the writings of the Holy Fathers, and to verify and test yourself always against the words of God in Holy Scripture.’”

At the same time, one must remember that anyone who seeks with sincerity and true longing can learn something valuable, even from simple people. The Holy Fathers affirm that if you turn with faith and the right intention, even to a Saracen, you could receive helpful advice. But if you approach even a Prophet without faith or pure intent, you will not gain anything from him. Saint Macarius the Great of Egypt is an example of this—he once received a lesson from a humble peasant that helped him overcome a passion.

As for being free from thoughts and images—that is, not imagining or accepting any vision of light, any angel, Christ, or any saint, and rejecting all thoughts during contemplation—the Holy Fathers insist on this from their own experience. They knew how easily the imagination can invent or produce thoughts in the mind. For this reason, someone without discernment could be drawn in by these images, mistake them for revelations of grace, and fall into deception, especially since Scripture itself warns that “even Satan can present himself as an angel of light.”

The mind is indeed capable of resting in a state without images or thoughts, even while standing in God’s presence. This is possible because the imagination itself can grasp what is formless, and it can hold to that while perceiving things invisible to the physical eye and free of any shape or form.

“Take, for example, how we perceive our own soul—or things like air, warmth, and cold. When someone is chilled, he can easily picture warmth in his mind, even though it has no shape or form, cannot be seen, and cannot be touched by the one who is cold. In the same way, the mind can perceive the presence of God, that spiritual and ungraspable Being, and the heart can know Him, even in the complete absence of thoughts or images.”

**Pilgrim:** “On my journeys I have also met devout people seeking salvation who told me they were afraid to attempt the inner spiritual life because of warnings about falling into delusion. Some of them were helped when I read to them from Saint Gregory of Sinai in the *Philokalia*: ‘The activity of the heart cannot be the work of delusion, as mental activity can. Even if the enemy tried to twist the warmth of the heart into his own burning heat, or to replace the joy of the heart with sensual pleasure, time, experience, and the very feeling itself would expose this trick, even to those not well-versed in his deceptions.’

“I also met others who, after experiencing the silence of solitude and the prayer of the heart, sadly fell into despair and abandoned this prayer they had learned, because they ran into obstacles or felt the weakness of sin.”

**Professor:** “But isn’t that quite natural? I have experienced the same—sometimes I let myself be carried away by distractions or fall into sin. Since the prayer of the heart is holy work, true union with God, is it really fitting to bring such a sacred practice into a sinful heart, without first cleansing it with silent, humble repentance and preparing properly for communion with God? Wouldn’t it be better to stand silently before Him than to let empty words pour out from a distracted heart filled with darkness?”

**Monk:** “How unfortunate that you think this way! Despair—worse than any other sin—is the chief weapon of the powers of darkness against us. Our Holy Fathers, who had great experience, teach very differently. The venerable Nikitas Stithatos says that even if you were to fall into the very depths of hell itself, you must not despair, but immediately turn to God, and He will raise up your fallen heart and give you greater strength than before.

So after every fall, after every wound of sin to the heart, you must place yourself at once before God, so that He may heal and cleanse you. It is like something impure that becomes less corrupt when exposed to the rays of the sun. Many spiritual teachers insist on this. While fighting against the enemies of salvation—our passions—we must never abandon the life-giving practice of calling on the Name of Jesus Christ, who dwells in our hearts! Our sins must not drive us away from God’s presence or from interior prayer—that only leads to anxiety, despair, and sorrow. Instead, our sins should drive us even more quickly into God’s arms. Just like a child guided by his mother: when he stumbles, he immediately turns back and clings tightly to her.”

**Hermit:** “I believe that despair and restless, doubtful thoughts arise most easily in a distracted mind, where there is no guarding silence. But in peaceful solitude, in quiet stillness, the ancient Fathers—filled with the wisdom of God—overcame despair and were given light within and the strength to place all their hope in God. They even left us this wise advice: ‘Sit in the silence of your cell, and it will teach you everything.’”

**Professor:** “Since I trust you, I would very much like to hear your thoughts on silence and the benefits of a solitary life, which you speak of so highly and which hermits value so much. Here is my concern: God created human nature so that people depend on each other, are obligated to help each other, to work for each other, and to contribute to one another’s well-being. This mutual reliance is the basis for humanity’s good and for love of neighbor. But when a hermit cuts himself off from others, how can he serve his neighbor or contribute to the good of society? Isn’t he breaking the Creator’s law of loving communion and the call to be a positive influence on his fellow man?”

**Hermit:** “Since your view of the solitary life is not correct, your conclusion is also mistaken. Let’s examine it more closely.

(1) A hermit living in silence does not live an idle or empty life. On the contrary, he is far more active than if he were living among society. He works tirelessly on the level of his higher, rational nature—observing, discerning, and keeping watch over the state and progress of his inner life. This is the true purpose of the solitary life! And just as he benefits himself through this pursuit of perfection, so too his neighbor benefits from it. For those who cannot live undistracted lives themselves receive help from the hermit’s experience, whether through his rare spoken words or more often through his writings. In this way, the solitary contributes to the spiritual good and salvation of his brothers and sisters.

He accomplishes this even more effectively than if he devoted himself to outward charitable works, because acts of social charity are limited by the few who can carry them out. But one who performs what we might call ‘moral charity’—acquiring knowledge and experience for the sake of the spiritual life—becomes a benefactor to entire nations. His insights and teachings are passed down from generation to generation, and we ourselves still benefit from them, even from ancient times. This is no different from the works of mercy done in Christ’s name and out of Christian love—indeed, it surpasses them in how far-reaching and enduring the good becomes.”

(2) The good and beneficial influence of a hermit on others is shown not only through his insights into the inner life, but also through the example of his solitary way of living. The very witness of his silence has power. When a devout layperson hears of a pious hermit, or even passes by his simple dwelling, something stirs within: a reverence, a memory of who man was created to be, and the realization that it is possible to return to the original contemplative state in which God first fashioned him. In this way, the hermit teaches without words. His very life instructs. He leads others to self-knowledge, to reverence, and to a longing for God.

(3) The blessings just described come from a true solitary life, one filled with silence and sustained by grace. Yet even if a hermit were not graced with such gifts, even if he chose a life of solitude merely to withdraw from people—because his laziness and negligence might otherwise tempt and harm others—still, even then, he would have a positive influence. His very separation from society would act like a gardener trimming away dry branches or uprooting harmful plants to allow healthier growth. Simply by removing himself from becoming a stumbling block, he serves the greater good. This in itself is of great benefit to the community—that by his ascetic life he avoids being a source of temptation, something that would be far harder to achieve if he remained in the midst of society, where temptations abound and where his weakness could corrupt the morality of those around him.

“Saint Isaac the Syrian says this about the life of silence: ‘If we gather all the activities of the world on one side, and place silence on the other, it is silence that will tip the scales. Do not compare those who perform miracles and great signs with those who live in true solitary silence. Love the stillness of silence more than feeding the hungry of the world or converting many nations to God. It is better to free yourself from the bonds of sin than to free others from slavery.’

Even the ancient wise men knew the value of silence. Under the teaching of the philosopher Plotinus, the Neo-Platonic school, followed by many renowned thinkers, emphasized developing the contemplative inner life—a life attained chiefly in the silence of solitude.

One spiritual writer even said that if a government were to reach the highest level of education and morality, it would still need more than civil servants; it would need contemplatives, too—those who carry the spirit of truth, inherit it from past generations, preserve it, and pass it on to the future. In the Church, such people are its hermits, ascetics, and anchorites.”

**Pilgrim:** “It seems to me that no one has expressed the greatness of silence better than Saint John of the Ladder: ‘Silent solitude,’ he says, ‘is the mother of prayer, a release from the prison of sin, a hidden progress in virtue, and a steady ascent to heaven.’ Even Jesus Christ Himself, at times, withdrew from the crowds and from teaching in order to pray alone and find peace—showing us the value and necessity of silence and solitude.

“Those who live in solitude are like pillars holding up the spiritual life of the Church with their unceasing prayers. From ancient times, we know that devout laypeople—even tsars and their officials—would go to hermits and anchorites to ask for their prayers, so that they might be strengthened and saved. So it is clear that a solitary hermit does serve his neighbor and contributes to the good of others through his prayer in silence.”

**Professor:** “And yet here is something I find difficult to understand. We Christians are used to asking for one another’s prayers, and I, too, feel the desire to be prayed for by others, especially by someone I trust as a member of the Church. But is this not simply an expression of self-love, or perhaps only a habit we’ve picked up from others, something we say without much thought?

“Does God really need our petitions, when in His providence He has already foreseen and arranged everything—not according to our desires, but according to His all-good will? Scripture even says that God already knows what we need before we ask Him. Can the prayers of many be more persuasive to Him than the prayers of one? Would that not make Him partial? And can another person’s prayer truly save me, when my own actions are what honor or condemn me?

“This is why I think that asking others for their prayers is only a kind of pious courtesy—a humble way of showing respect and love to one another—but nothing more.”

**Monk:** “It might look that way if you view it superficially, with ordinary reasoning. But when spiritual reason is illuminated by faith and shaped through the experience of the inner life, it sees more deeply, considers more clearly, and reveals a truth quite opposite to what you have said.

“To make this easier to understand, let’s use an example, and then we’ll see how it is confirmed in Scripture. Imagine a student who goes to learn from a teacher. Because of his weak abilities—and also his laziness and lack of focus—he makes no progress. He falls behind, gains a reputation as lazy, and grows discouraged, not knowing how to overcome his weaknesses.

“One day he meets another student, a classmate who is more capable, diligent, and attentive. The struggling student confides in him about his difficulties. The stronger one shows compassion and suggests, ‘Let’s study together. It will encourage us both, and make it more enjoyable. We’ll learn much more this way.’

“So they begin to work side by side, sharing what each learns. And what happens after just a few days? The weaker student grows diligent. He develops a love for study, his laziness fades, and he begins to understand what once was beyond him. This change even shapes his character and strengthens his moral life. Meanwhile, his more capable classmate becomes even stronger and more industrious. By helping each other, both receive benefit.”

“But that’s only natural, for man is born into community. It is through others that he learns to think and understand, from them he acquires his habits, his emotions, and his goals. In short, he learns everything from the example of others like himself. Since people’s lives are woven tightly together and powerfully influence one another, a calm and passionless person can become inflamed, a dull one can become wise, and a lazy one diligent, simply through interaction.

“A spirit can pass from one person to another, inspiring prayer, urging vigilance, lifting someone out of despair, or turning them from sin toward devotion. In this way, the one who strengthens his neighbor also grows stronger himself, becoming more devout, more steadfast in ascetic struggles, and more pleasing to God. This is the mystery of praying for others. It explains that cherished Christian custom of interceding for one another and asking our brothers and sisters for their prayers.

“It is clear, then, that prayer is not about satisfying God with a flood of petitions, as though He were an earthly ruler swayed by numbers. No, it is the very spirit and power of prayer that cleanses and stirs the soul of the one for whom prayer is offered, making it ready for union with God. And if prayer for the living has such power, then surely prayers for the departed are just as fruitful. The deep bonds between this life and the next unite the souls of the Church on earth with the souls of the Church in heaven.

“Though everything I have said may sound like psychology, we can be certain of its truth by turning to Holy Scripture. (1) Jesus said to the Apostle Peter, ‘But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail’ \[Luke 22:32]. Here, the power of Christ’s prayer strengthens Peter in his trial. (2) When Peter was in prison, the Church prayed for him, showing us how communal prayer can sustain us in hardship. (3) And the command to pray for one another is expressed most clearly by James: ‘Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The fervent prayer of a righteous man has great power’ \[James 5:16]. The truths reason suggests are here confirmed in Scripture.”

“And what shall we say of the Apostle Paul, who stands before us as an example of praying for one another? One writer notes that his example should convince us how truly necessary it is to intercede for each other—since even such a holy man, such a mighty spiritual champion, admitted his own need for the prayers of others. In his letter to the Hebrews, he makes this request plainly: *‘Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honorably’* \[Heb. 13:18].

“After hearing this, how foolish it would be for anyone to rely only on his own prayers and efforts, when even this humble, grace-filled apostle asked his brethren to join their prayers to his. If such a saint welcomed the prayers of the Hebrews, how much more should we receive, with humility and sincerity, the prayers of even the weakest among us! For Paul himself did not draw distinctions—he asked for the prayers of the whole community, knowing that the power of God is revealed in weakness and can shine even through prayers that appear small or feeble.

“Once we are convinced by this example, we also see how praying for one another upholds the unity of Christian love commanded by God. It becomes the proof of humility in the one who prays, and the proof of love in the one prayed for. And it stirs up mutual prayer, weaving together the fellowship of all believers.”

**Professor:** “Your explanation and all the evidence you’ve given are wonderful and precise. But I would like to hear from you about the very method, the formula, for praying for others. If the power and encouragement of prayer come from our relationship with our neighbor—and especially from the influence that the one praying has on the soul of the one being prayed for—wouldn’t such a focus distract us from unceasing prayer, from placing ourselves continually before God, and from pouring out our own needs to Him? Yet if I only remember my neighbor once or twice a day and ask God to help him, is that really enough to strengthen his soul and draw him into communion? In other words, I want to know: how, and by what means, should I pray for others?”

**Monk:** “When prayer is offered to God, no matter what the request, it never distracts us from being in His presence—because prayer is always an outpouring to God, and so it must take place before Him.

“As for how to pray for one’s neighbor, the power of such prayer lies in the sincerity of one’s Christian relationship with him. The effect it has on his soul depends on the depth of that bond. So when you remember someone—or when you set aside time for it—turn your heart to God and pray like this: *‘Merciful Lord, may Your will be done, You who desire all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Have mercy on and save Your servant (name). Accept this prayer as an offering of the love You Yourself command us to have for one another.’*

“These words are usually said when the soul feels a special stirring, or when one is praying with the *chotki* (prayer rope). I have personally seen the good that such prayer brings to those for whom it is offered.”

**Professor:** “I will always remember this wise conversation and the light I’ve received from hearing your words. I thank you deeply from my heart.”

**Pilgrim and Professor:** “And now the time has come for us to leave. We ask you sincerely to keep us in your prayers, that they may go with us on our journey.”

**Skhimnik:** “Now may the God of peace, who raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.” [Heb. 13:20–21]
