# Chapter 7

> “. . . pray one for another that you may be healed.” —JAMES 5:16

**Pilgrim:** “My devout traveling companion, the professor, and I could not leave without fulfilling our mutual wish to bid you a final farewell and to ask you to pray for us.”

**Professor:** “Yes, we have felt the sincerity of your heart and the redemptive conversations that brought us joy in your home and in the company of your friends. This memory will remain with us always, a pledge of communion and Christian love, even in the distant country where we are headed.”

**Starets:** “Thank you for remembering me and for your love. You have arrived at the perfect moment! There are two travelers staying with me: a Moldavian monk and a hermit who has lived in solitude in the forest for twenty years. They would like to meet you—I’ll go get them. . . .

“Here they are!”

**Pilgrim:** “Ah! How blessed is the life of a hermit! How it draws the soul wholly to union with God! The silence of the forest is like the Garden of Eden, where the sweet tree of life grows in the prayerful heart of a hermit. If only I had enough to support myself, I think I would always live as a hermit.”

**Professor:** “From a distance, everything often seems exceptionally good. Yet experience teaches that every place of advantage carries its own challenges. Of course, for those inclined toward solitude, the hermit’s life is appealing. Yet how perilous it can be! The history of asceticism shows many examples of hermits and ascetics who, having abandoned all contact with others, fell into megalomania and deep delusion.”
