A whole year had passed since I last saw the pilgrim. Then, at last, there was a soft knock at the door, and a gentle voice announced the arrival of that dear brother—bringing great joy to the one who had been waiting for him.

**Starets:** “Come in, beloved brother! Let us give thanks to the Lord together, who has blessed both your journey and your safe return!”

**Pilgrim:** “Glory and thanks to the Most High, the Father of all goodness, for everything He provides out of His wisdom—whatever is best for us, pilgrims and strangers in a foreign land. Here I am again, a sinner who left you last year, and by God’s mercy has been granted the joy of seeing you and hearing your kind welcome once more.

“Of course, you're expecting to hear a detailed account of the holy city of God—Jerusalem—which I longed to visit with all my heart and toward which I directed all my efforts. But as you know, not everything we desire comes to pass. That’s what happened to me—and it's no surprise. How could I, a poor sinner, be worthy to walk the sacred ground that still bears the footprints of our Lord Jesus Christ?

“You’ll remember, Father, that I left here last year with a companion—an elderly man who was deaf—and I carried a letter from a merchant in Irkutsk to his son in Odessa, asking him to help arrange passage for me to Jerusalem. Well, we made it safely to Odessa without any trouble. My companion quickly booked a spot on a ship headed for Constantinople and departed. I stayed behind and went looking for the merchant’s son, to whom the letter was addressed.

“I found his house easily, but to my deep sorrow and surprise, I learned that my benefactor had died just three weeks earlier after a short illness. He was already buried. I was grieved, but I surrendered it all to the will of God.

“The household was in mourning. His widow, who was left with three small children, was overwhelmed by sorrow—she cried constantly and fainted from grief several times a day. It looked like she might not live long either. Still, in the midst of all this, she received me kindly. Since she couldn’t send me to Jerusalem herself, she allowed me to stay as her guest for two weeks, until her late husband’s father was expected to return to Odessa to handle the family’s affairs and settle the accounts.

“So I stayed.”

I stayed with them for a week, then a month—and then another month passed. But the merchant never arrived. Instead, he sent a letter saying that due to his own difficulties, he couldn’t come. He told the family to settle all their affairs and come join him in Irkutsk as soon as possible.

That set off a whirlwind of activity as they made plans to leave. Seeing that they were now too busy to keep hosting me, I thanked them for their kind hospitality to a stranger, said my goodbyes, and continued on my journey through Russia.

For a while, I wasn’t sure where to go next. But eventually, I decided to head to Kiev, since I hadn’t been there in many years. So I set off.

At first, I was truly saddened that my dream of visiting Jerusalem hadn’t come true. But I reminded myself that even this disappointment was part of God’s divine plan. That gave me comfort. I hoped that the Lord, who loves all people, would accept the desire of my heart as though I had actually made the journey—and that He would still guide me and bless my path with spiritual fruit.

And that’s exactly what happened. Along the way, I met people who opened my eyes to things I’d never known before—people who brought light to my soul and helped it toward salvation. If events hadn’t taken this turn, I never would have crossed paths with these spiritual guides.

So I continued walking during the day with the prayer always with me, like a faithful companion. At night, I would find a place to stay and read from my *Philokalia* to strengthen my soul and keep it alert in its struggle against the unseen forces that try to pull us away from salvation.

Then, about seventy versts from Odessa, something unusual happened.

I came across a long train of wagons—about thirty carts—carrying goods. I caught up to them, and I noticed that one of the drivers, who was near the front, was walking alongside his horse. The rest of the drivers were farther back, traveling together in a group.

We came to a pond fed by cold underground springs. Because of the early spring thaw, chunks of ice were floating around its edges, crashing into each other with a loud, eerie sound.

Suddenly, the young man leading the caravan stopped his horse, which brought the whole train of carts to a halt. All the other drivers ran up to see what was going on—and there he was, beginning to take off his clothes. They asked him why, and he calmly said that he had an overwhelming urge to swim in the icy pond.

Everyone was stunned. Some laughed at him, others scolded him and called him mad. His older brother, who was also part of the group, tried to stop him and pleaded with him to get back on the road.

But the young man wouldn’t budge. He insisted on what he felt.

A few of the younger drivers, thinking it was all a joke, dipped buckets into the icy pond and splashed water on him—on his head, on his neck—saying, “There you go! Here’s your bath!”

The moment the cold water touched his body, he cried out, “Oh! How wonderful!” Then he sat down on the ground as they kept splashing him. Not long after that, he lay down—and quietly, peacefully—he died.

Everyone stood in shock, unsure of what had just happened. Some of the older men grew anxious and said they would need to report it to the authorities. Others just shook their heads and said, “It must have been his time to go.”

I stayed with the group of wagon drivers for about an hour, still trying to take in what I had just witnessed. Then I continued on my way. After walking about three and a half miles, I came to a village right off the main road.

As I entered the village, I came across an elderly priest walking down the street. I felt compelled to share the strange event I had seen, curious to hear his thoughts. The priest invited me into his home, and after I told him the whole story, I asked him if he could help me understand what had happened.

He listened quietly, then said, “Dear brother, there’s not much I can tell you for certain—only that many things in this life are mysterious and far beyond our understanding. I believe that sometimes God allows events like this to occur so that His presence and divine order in the world become more visible to us, often through what seems unnatural or sudden.”

Then the priest shared a story of his own.

“Near our village, there’s a deep, narrow ravine—very steep, at least ten sazhen deep. Just looking into it gives you chills. Somehow, a narrow pedestrian bridge was built across it.

“One day, a peasant from my parish—a good, decent man with a family—began feeling a strong, strange urge to throw himself into that ravine. He struggled with the thought for an entire week, deeply tormented by it. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore. One morning, he got up early, rushed to the ravine, and jumped off the bridge.

“People heard his cries and managed to pull him out, though it was very difficult, and both of his legs were badly broken. When they asked him why he had done such a thing, he said that even though he was in terrible pain, he felt at peace. He said that giving in to the urge that had haunted him so intensely all week had somehow quieted his soul. It was as if he had been willing to die just to find relief.”

The priest continued his story.

“The man was treated in the city hospital for over a year. I visited him there from time to time. Just like you, I hoped to hear the doctors offer some explanation for what had happened. But when I asked them, they all said the same thing—it was a case of ‘obsession.’

“I pressed them for a scientific explanation. Why do these things happen? What causes such torment in a person? But they had nothing more to offer. All they could say was that it was one of nature’s mysteries, something science doesn’t yet understand.

“So I told them, ‘If a person were to turn to God in prayer in moments like these—and if they shared their inner struggle with people who are kind and wise—then even a force as powerful as an “obsession” might lose its grip.’ It’s true—there are many things in life that simply can’t be explained.”

Evening fell while we talked, so I stayed the night. The next morning, a clerk from the district police came to ask the priest for permission to bury the man who had died in the river. He said the autopsy found no signs of insanity, and the official cause of death was listed as a sudden stroke.

“You see?” said the priest. “Even medicine had no explanation for what drove him to the water. Not everything has a clear reason.”

I thanked the priest and continued on my journey. After traveling for several days, I was worn out when I arrived at a large trading town called Byelaya Tserkov. As the sun began to set, I started looking for a place to stay the night.

In the town marketplace, I saw a man who looked like a traveler, much like myself. He was going from shop to shop, asking for directions to someone’s home. When he saw me, he came over and said, “You look like a pilgrim too. Why don’t we go together? I’m looking for a man named Yevreinov. He’s a good Christian, runs a prosperous coaching inn, and is known for welcoming pilgrims. Look, I even wrote down his address.”

I was glad to join him, and before long, we found the place.

Though the host wasn’t home at the time, his wife—a kind, elderly woman—greeted us warmly. She showed us to a cozy room in the attic where we could rest. We settled in for a bit, and after a while, the host returned and invited us to share dinner with him.

Over the meal, we got to talking—about who we were, where we’d come from. Then, somehow, the question came up: why did he have the name Yevreinov?

“The poor man was driven to despair. Then one day, he heard someone say that even the most terrible demonic visions flee at the sign of the Cross. With nothing left to lose, and as a desperate experiment, he got hold of a Cross and wore it around his neck. From that moment on, the vision stopped tormenting him.

“After that, he began secretly attending Christian churches and reading the Gospels. Over time, his heart softened. The bitterness he once held was replaced by a deep hunger for truth. Eventually, he was baptized and became a Christian, taking the name John. He left his hometown, settled here, and married. I was born his only son.

“I chose to take the surname ‘Yevreinov,’ meaning ‘son of a Jew,’ not out of shame, but to always remember the mysterious way God can reach even the hardest of hearts and bring light out of darkness. My father used to say that the suffering he went through was God’s mercy—because through it, he found truth, peace, and salvation.”

We were deeply moved by this story. As the evening wore on, we prayed together and gave thanks for the mysterious and wondrous ways God works in human lives.

After dinner, we gave thanks—both to God and to our kind host—and made our way up to the little attic room where we were staying. We weren’t quite ready to sleep yet, so we started talking.

My traveling companion shared a bit of his story. He was a merchant from Mogilets, though his heart had already begun turning toward the monastic life. For two years, he’d lived as a novice in one of the monasteries in Bessarabia, but only on a temporary passport. Now, he was heading home to get a permanent release from the merchants’ association so he could return to the monastery for good.

He spoke with such affection for the Bessarabian monasteries—the way they were run, the depth of the spiritual life there, the discipline, the wisdom of the startsi (those gentle elders who guide others in the way of prayer). He said that compared to the monasteries in Russia, it was like comparing heaven and earth. He encouraged me to go there myself.

While we were still talking, another guest arrived—a non-commissioned officer on leave from the army. He was clearly worn out from his journey, so after a short introduction and a shared prayer, we all lay down to sleep.

At daybreak, we began to pack up and get ready to continue our journey. But just as we were about to thank our host and leave, the sound of church bells rang out—calling the faithful to matins.

The merchant and I stopped in our tracks. How could we just walk away after hearing that sacred call? How could we turn our backs on the invitation to stand in God’s presence, to join the prayers of the Church? We looked at each other and quickly agreed—it would be better to attend the service first, to pray with others in the holy stillness of the temple. Then, when we left, it would feel right. Our steps would be lighter, our hearts more peaceful.

We turned to the officer and invited him to come with us. He shook his head. “Why bother?” he said. “What does it matter to God if we go to church now? I’ll pray when I get home. You go if you want—I’m heading out now. While you’re at matins, I’ll have a three-mile head start, and honestly, I can’t wait to be home.”

The merchant looked at him kindly but seriously. “Be careful, my friend,” he said. “You don’t know what the future holds. God might have something different in mind for you.”

So, the merchant and I went to church, while the officer headed out on his own. The matins service was held quite early—gentle and still, just as the day was beginning. When it ended, we walked back to our room to gather our things. But before we could even finish packing, our hostess appeared with a steaming samovar in her hands.

“And where do you think you’re going?” she said, smiling. “Here, have some tea—and stay for dinner while you’re at it. We won’t let you leave on an empty stomach!”

We couldn’t refuse such kindness. So we sat down and began sipping our tea. We hadn’t been there long—maybe half an hour—when suddenly, we saw the officer running toward us, completely out of breath.

“I’ve come to you full of grief… and joy,” he said.

Naturally, we were alarmed. “What happened?” we asked.

He caught his breath and told us the story:

“Right after I left you, I decided to stop at the inn. I needed to break a large bill and figured a quick shot of vodka would make the journey easier. I changed my money, had my drink, and set off feeling light on my feet.

“About two miles down the road, I thought I’d double-check the money—just to be sure the innkeeper hadn’t shorted me. I sat down at the side of the road, pulled out my wallet, and counted everything. It was all there. But then I reached for my passport… and it was gone. Just like that.

“I panicked. My head started spinning. Where could it be? Then it hit me—I must’ve dropped it at the inn while I was changing money. I turned right around and ran back, my mind racing with all sorts of fears: *What if it’s gone? What if someone took it? What will I do?*

“I got back and asked the innkeeper, but he just shrugged and said he hadn’t seen it. My heart sank. I started searching everywhere—around the tables, underfoot, in the corners where I’d stood.

“And would you believe it? There it was. Folded just the way I’d left it, lying in the hay and trash on the floor, trampled and filthy but still intact.

“I was so relieved I nearly cried. It was dirty, sure, and I might get a harsh punishment for how it looks—but I didn’t care. I was just grateful to have it back. At least I’d be able to get home.

“But that’s not all,” he added, wincing. “While I was running back in such a panic, I tore the skin clean off my foot on some rocks. Now I can hardly walk. I came back to tell you everything… and, well, to ask if you’ve got a bit of lard I could use on the wound.”

The merchant looked at the officer with compassion in his eyes, but he didn’t hold back his words.

“You see, my friend? This is what happens when we ignore the quiet invitations of the Spirit. You didn’t come with us to pray, even when the bells rang out like a whisper from heaven. You wanted to get ahead, to reach your destination faster—and yet, here you are, right back with us, limping and sore.

“I tried to warn you—not to rush ahead, not to assume you knew what the road would hold. And now, well... here we are.

“But more than that, it wasn’t just that you skipped church—you even said, *‘What good is it to God if we pray?’* That’s a dangerous way to think.

“No, God doesn’t need our imperfect prayers. But in His deep, unshakable love for us, He *loves* when we pray. Even the smallest prayer, even a feeble, wandering one, is precious to Him.

“It’s not only the rare and perfect moments of pure prayer—the kind the Holy Spirit breathes into our souls—that bring Him joy. No, it’s every flicker of desire, every little movement of our hearts toward Him that delights Him. He asks us to *abide in Him*, and He promises to abide in us. Every time we even *want* to respond to that call, He meets us there.

“God notices every little step we take in His direction. Every honest intention. Every whisper of love. Even the thought, *‘Maybe I’ll try to turn toward God today’*—He treasures it. And in His generosity, He pours back a thousand times more love than we ever give.

“You offer a mite, and He returns a treasure. You think of turning toward Him, and already He’s running to meet you. You whisper, *‘Have mercy on me,’* and He’s already wrapping His arms around you like a Father who’s just found His long-lost child.

“That’s the kind of love God has. That’s what makes heaven rejoice—not because we’re perfect, but because we keep turning back, again and again, however small the step.

“So don’t tell yourself it’s useless when your prayer drifts or your attention scatters. Don’t dismiss those little moments—sighing from the heart, making a small offering, resisting a temptation, bearing a slight offense in silence, or simply calling on the name of Jesus Christ. All of that matters. Every bit of it matters to God.”

“You see,” the merchant continued, “you might think these small efforts don’t amount to much. That they don’t *really* matter. But I’m telling you—they do. Not a single act of goodness, no matter how tiny or hidden, is ever wasted. Each one is seen by the loving, watchful eye of God. And each one will be honored—richly. Not only in the life to come, but even in this one.

“Saint John Chrysostom said it beautifully: *‘No good deed, however small, is ever scorned by the Righteous Judge.’* If our sins are weighed so carefully—if even our stray thoughts and words are counted—how much more will the good we do, even when it's humble and imperfect, be noticed and cherished by our all-loving Judge?

“Let me tell you a story—something I witnessed myself.

“There was a monk in Bessarabia, a good man, sincere in his faith. One day, he found himself battling a craving for dried fish. It doesn’t sound like much, does it? But for him, it was a real struggle. At the time, there was no dried fish to be found in the monastery, and the thought came to him: *Maybe I should go out to the market and get some.*

“He went back and forth with himself. On one hand, monks are called to be content with what is given—to live simply, to avoid seeking pleasure. And besides, the marketplace was full of distractions and temptations, not a place for a monk to wander.

“But the craving got the better of him. Against his better judgment, he decided to go.

“He left the monastery and started down the city street. As he walked, he suddenly realized—he didn’t have his *chotki* (his prayer rope) in hand. And right away, something stirred in him. *How can I walk through the city like this? I look like a soldier without a sword. People will see me and wonder… they might even be troubled by it.*

“Just as he was about to turn back, he reached into his pocket—and there it was. The chotki. He pulled it out, made the sign of the cross, slipped it over his fingers, and continued on his way—his mind now at peace.”

The merchant went on.

“As the monk approached the busy marketplace, he saw a horse standing near the shops, hitched to a large cart loaded with huge vats. Suddenly, something startled the horse—it bolted, hooves clattering wildly against the cobblestones. In an instant, it crashed into the monk, brushing his shoulder and knocking him hard to the ground.

“He wasn’t seriously hurt, but the shock left him breathless. And then—just two steps from where he’d fallen—the cart tipped violently, the entire load smashing into the ground with a deafening crash. The cart was reduced to splinters.

“He lay there stunned. If he’d been just a moment slower… if he’d taken just one more step… he would’ve been crushed along with it.

“Shaken, but grateful to be alive, he got up, dusted himself off, and continued on. He bought the dried fish, returned to the monastery, ate, prayed, and went to bed.

“But later that night, as he drifted into a light sleep, something remarkable happened. A dignified elder—a *starets* he didn’t recognize—appeared to him in a dream.

“‘Listen,’ the elder said gently, ‘I am the patron of this monastery. I’ve come to help you understand the lesson hidden in what happened today.

“‘Your struggle with temptation was weak. You gave in too easily, and you failed to examine your own heart deeply enough. That opened the door to danger—and the enemy took the chance to stir up trouble.

“‘But your guardian angel was watching. He stirred something in you—the memory of your *chotki*, the longing to pray. And you listened. You obeyed. You took that tiny step back toward God.

“‘And that small, almost forgotten act—that flicker of faithfulness—*saved your life*. Do you see? Can you understand now how tenderly God watches over us, and how richly He rewards even the smallest turning of the heart toward Him?’”

The monk awoke with a start—but not in his bed. He found himself kneeling on the floor, prostrate at the threshold of his cell door.

He wasted no time sharing the vision with others, including me. He wanted everyone to hear what had happened—not to bring attention to himself, but to offer a glimpse of how near God's mercy truly is, and how even the smallest gesture of love and remembrance can become a doorway to grace.

The merchant sat quietly for a moment, then let out a soft sigh.

“God’s love for us is truly beyond all measure,” he said. “Just think—something as small as pulling a *chotki* out of his pocket, slipping it over his hand, and calling on the Name of God once... that alone was enough to preserve a man’s life.

“On the grand scales of eternity, that one, tiny moment of turning toward Jesus outweighed hours and hours of hesitation, distraction, even spiritual laziness. A single whisper of the Name tipped the balance. A small act, repaid with something far greater than it seemed to deserve. A simple mite, returned with a gold coin.

“Do you see now how powerful prayer truly is? How mighty is the Name of Jesus Christ when we speak it with even a sliver of sincerity?

“In the *Philokalia*, Saint John of Karpathos says that when we pray the Jesus Prayer—*‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner’*—God’s own mystical voice responds to every cry with these words: *‘Child, your sins are forgiven.’*

“And he goes even further. He says that in that very moment of prayer, we are no different from the saints, the martyrs, and the blessed. Not because we’ve earned it, but because prayer unites us all in the presence of God. Saint John Chrysostom said the same: *‘Prayer cleanses instantly, even if it is spoken by a sinner.’*

“Such is the mercy of God! And yet, what do we so often do? We cling to our worries and distractions. We say we don’t have time. We forget God—and worse, we forget that we belong to Him. We put off prayer as if it’s optional, while filling our days with things that vanish as quickly as they come.

“And sometimes, when things fall apart and hardships come, we wonder why. But even those moments—those unexpected trials—can be used by God in His mercy to wake us up, to teach us, and to draw us closer to Him again.”

He paused, his eyes soft with feeling.

As soon as he finished speaking to the officer, I couldn’t help myself. I said to him, “Sir, you’ve filled my poor soul with such joy—I feel like bowing before your feet in thanks.”

He smiled and turned to me. “Ah, so you enjoy stories about spiritual matters, do you? Just wait a moment—I have something for you.”

He reached into his things and pulled out a small, well-worn pocketbook.

“This,” he said, “is *Agapia*, or *Salvation for Sinners*. It’s filled with stories of miraculous events—much like the one I just shared.”

The merchant pulled the small book from his pocket and carefully opened its worn cover. His eyes scanned the pages until he found the story he was looking for. Then he began to read aloud, his voice quiet and steady.

It was the story of a devout man named Agaphonik. From his earliest years, his parents had taught him to stand each day before an icon of the Mother of God and pray the ancient words: *“Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos…”* And so he did—day after day, year after year.

But as time went on, and life’s demands grew louder, his heart grew dull. He began to pray it less and less, until one day… he stopped altogether.

Then, one evening, Agaphonik welcomed a pilgrim into his home. The man told him he was a hermit from the desert of Thebaid. And with a solemn gaze, he said, “I’ve been sent to you. In a vision, I was told to come and remind you—rebuke you, really—for abandoning your prayer to the Mother of God.”

Agaphonik was surprised. “But I prayed that prayer for years,” he said. “And I never saw anything come of it. So eventually, I gave up.”

The hermit shook his head. “You’ve forgotten, haven’t you? How many times that prayer saved you, protected you, even without your knowing?

“Remember your youth—when you nearly drowned, but somehow came out safe. Remember the time a deadly plague swept through your village and so many around you died… but you stayed healthy.

“Or that time you and your friend were thrown from a carriage? He broke his leg. You didn’t even have a bruise.

“And what about that young, strong man you used to know—who’s now an invalid, while you’re still healthy and able to walk without pain?”

The hermit went on, recalling moment after moment, gently helping Agaphonik see all the quiet mercies that had followed him. Finally, he said:

“All of these—every single one—was the fruit of that simple prayer. Through it, your soul was lifted toward God, and the Most Holy Theotokos kept watch over you. Her intercession wrapped around you like a mother’s arms. So do not abandon her now. Keep praying. Keep glorifying the Queen of Heaven. For if you stop… she may no longer be there to protect you.”

When the merchant finished reading, we were called to dinner. The room was quiet for a moment—each of us taking in the story in our own way.

We ate with gratitude, thanked our host warmly, and then prepared to part ways—each of us continuing on our own journey, led by the path set before us.

I continued on foot for about five days, carrying with me the warmth of the stories I had heard from the devout merchant from Byelaya Tserkov. His words lingered in my heart like soft embers—comforting, glowing.

But as I neared Kiev, something in me shifted. I didn’t know why, but a heavy weariness came over me—both in body and in spirit. I felt drained, troubled by gloomy thoughts. My prayer grew dry, and I was swept up in a kind of spiritual laziness. It was hard to lift my soul. Hard to remember why I was walking at all.

Off to the side of the road, I noticed a wooded area and a thicket of trees. I turned from the path and wandered in, looking for a quiet place to sit—somewhere hidden, where I could rest and turn again to the *Philokalia* for strength. I hoped its words would water the withered ground of my heart.

I found a secluded spot behind a bush, and there I opened the book and began reading from the teachings of the Venerable Cassian the Roman, from part four of the *Philokalia*, on the eight thoughts that trouble the soul.

About half an hour passed, and I found myself drawn into his words—rich and nourishing. Then, as I glanced up into the forest, I noticed something strange. Not far off—perhaps a hundred paces away—I saw a man kneeling motionless in the woods. His stillness caught me. He looked deep in prayer.

The sight warmed me. I smiled to myself, thinking, *What faithful souls still walk this earth, quietly communing with God.*

I went back to my reading.

An hour passed. Maybe more. And when I looked up again, he was still there—still kneeling, perfectly still.

My heart was stirred by this silent devotion.

But then, suddenly, the man collapsed, crumpling to the ground. He didn’t move. I couldn’t see his face—he had always been turned away from me—but now I felt compelled to find out who he was, and whether he was alright.

I walked over slowly and found that he wasn’t hurt—just asleep. He lay there lightly dozing. He was a young man, maybe twenty-five years old, with a clean, pale face and soft features. He wore a simple peasant’s caftan, belted at the waist with a rope made of bast. He carried nothing with him—no bag, no staff, no belongings at all.

The sound of my steps stirred him, and he stood up quietly.

I asked who he was.

He told me he was a state peasant from the Smolensk province. He had come from Kiev and was now making his way onward.

“So where are you heading now?” I asked him.

He shrugged slightly and answered, “I don’t know. Wherever God takes me.”

I was quiet for a moment, then asked, “Has it been long since you left home?”

“Yes,” he said, “this is my fifth year.”

“And where have you stayed during that time?”

“I’ve gone to many places—holy sites, monasteries, churches. I just keep moving. There’s not much reason to stay home. I’m an orphan, no family. And my leg isn’t right—hasn’t been since I was little. So I wander.”

I looked at him, full of both compassion and respect. “It seems someone close to God must’ve guided you—not just to wander aimlessly, but to walk with purpose, visiting sacred places.”

He smiled faintly and began to tell me more.

“Well,” he said, “I grew up poor. Since I was a boy, I worked as a shepherd in our village. For about ten years everything was fine. But then one day, after I brought the herd back in, I noticed something—my village elder’s best sheep was missing. And this elder was a harsh man—mean, with no pity in him.

“When he saw the sheep was gone, he ran at me in a rage, cursing and threatening. He shouted, ‘Go find it, or I’ll beat you to death! I’ll break your arms and legs!’

“I knew he meant it—he was capable of anything. So I went out searching, retracing the places the herd had grazed. I searched into the night—past midnight. No sign of the sheep.

“It was a pitch-black night, nearly autumn. I wandered deep into the woods—thick forest, the kind that’s hard to push through in our province. Then the storm came. The trees started groaning and bending with the wind. Wolves howled in the distance. I was terrified. My whole body went cold. I thought I would faint from fear and loneliness.

“And in that moment, I dropped to my knees. I didn’t know what else to do. I made the sign of the cross over myself and cried out with all the strength I had: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.’*

“And the moment I said it, peace came over me—like a warm light filled my chest. The fear disappeared. My heart felt light—so full of joy, like I had been lifted up to heaven.

“I was so amazed, I just kept saying the prayer, over and over. And I don’t remember how long I knelt there. I don’t remember the rest of the night. The next thing I knew, the sun had risen, and I was still kneeling in the same spot.

“I stood up calmly. The sheep was gone, still, but my heart was full. I felt drawn to keep praying that little Here is the next part, lovingly adapted in the same devotional, reflective tone. Let it unfold gently, as if you're sitting with these two pilgrims by candlelight:

---

“As soon as I got back to the village,” the young man continued, “the elder saw that I had come home without his sheep. And without a word, he beat me—so badly that he twisted my leg. I was left nearly lifeless.

“For six weeks, I lay barely able to move. But even then, I kept repeating that little prayer: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.’* It was the only thing that brought me comfort. I’d whisper it through the pain, and somehow it gave me strength.

“Eventually I healed a little, enough to walk again, though my leg was never the same. And when I could, I left the village and began to roam the world. I didn’t like being around people too much—they talk too much, and there’s so much sin and noise. So I started making pilgrimages to holy places. When I wasn’t in a monastery, I wandered through the forests alone.

“This is now the fifth year of that life.”

As he spoke, my heart filled with joy—deep, holy joy—that the Lord had allowed me to meet such a man. Grace radiated from him, quiet and unpretentious. I looked at him with warmth and asked, “And now? Do you still keep praying that prayer constantly?”

He nodded, almost smiling. “I couldn’t live without it,” he said. “Whenever I remember how I felt that night in the forest, it’s like something nudges me, and I fall to my knees. I just start to pray without thinking.

“I don’t know if my sinful prayer is any good. But sometimes, when I pray, I feel this joy—I don’t know where it comes from. Like something inside me becomes free. There’s this happy peace, like everything’s okay, even if nothing looks different.

“But other times, I feel tired. Bored. Even a little depressed. Still, I want to pray. I always want to pray—until I die.”

I leaned closer and said gently, “Do not be confused, kind brother. All of it is pleasing to God. All of it is part of your salvation.

“The Holy Fathers teach us that whatever happens during prayer—joy or dryness, freedom or struggle—it is all good. Nothing is wasted in prayer. No effort, no word, no breath is lost before God.

“When you feel inner freedom, spiritual sweetness, or a strong desire to pray—this is God rewarding your effort. He’s encouraging you with comfort and grace.

“But when you feel tired, numb, or spiritually dry—this too is from God. He is purifying your soul. He is strengthening you through patience. And through humility, He is preparing you to receive even greater sweetness when the time is right.

“Here, let me show you,” I said, reaching for my book. “Let’s read from Saint John of the Ladder together.”

I found the passage I was looking for and read it aloud to him. He listened with quiet attention and seemed deeply moved. When I finished, he looked at me with gratitude in his eyes and thanked me again and again.

Then, without another word, he turned and walked back into the forest—disappearing into the trees like a bird returning to its nest. I stood there a while, watching him go. My heart was full. I turned back to the road and resumed my own journey, giving thanks to God, who had seen fit to bless a sinner like me with such a holy encounter.

By God's grace, I reached Kiev the next day. And the moment I entered that sacred city, my first desire was clear: I wanted to fast, to confess my sins, and to receive the Holy Mysteries of Christ in this blessed place. Everything else felt secondary. My soul longed for cleansing and communion.

I found lodging near the holy relics of the saints, so I could easily attend church services. A kind old Cossack took me in. He lived alone in a small hut, and it was a quiet, peaceful place—just what I needed for prayer and reflection.

As the week of preparation for confession unfolded, I resolved to make a full and honest confession. I wanted nothing left in the shadows. I turned my mind back over the years of my life, sifting through my memories. I tried to remember every sin, no matter how small.

To help myself, I began writing everything down. Every word, every deed that had grieved my conscience, I recorded. By the end, the list was long—far longer than I had expected. But I felt lighter, just for having named the truth.

Then I remembered something I had heard: about four and a half miles outside of Kiev, in the quiet Kitayev Hermitage, lived a spiritual father known for his deep wisdom and quiet holiness. People said he lived an ascetic life and possessed profound discernment. Anyone who spoke with him left changed—comforted, instructed, and spiritually renewed.

I was filled with joy at the thought of meeting this holy elder, and without hesitation, I went to see him. We spoke at length, and then I handed him my long list of sins.

He read through it carefully, then looked at me with kind but serious eyes.

“You, dear brother, have written many empty words,” he said gently. “Listen closely to what I must tell you:

First, you should not confess sins again that you have already repented of and have been absolved for, and which you have not repeated. To do so shows a lack of trust in the power of Confession itself.

Second, when confessing, do not bring up others involved in your sins. Confess only your own failings.

Third, the Holy Fathers warn us not to confess sins in excessive detail or with insinuations. Speak of them in general terms—too much personal scrutiny can lead both you and your confessor into temptation.

Fourth, you say you have come to repent, but you are not truly repentant for *not knowing how to repent.* Your repentance feels cold and careless.

Fifth, though you have listed many trivial things, you have missed the most important ones. You have not acknowledged that you do not love God as you ought; that you despise your neighbor; that you doubt the words of Scripture; and that pride and ambition fill your heart.

“Understand this: the abyss of evil and all spiritual corruption springs from these four roots. From them, all sinful shoots grow.”

I was taken aback. “Forgive me, Venerable Father,” I said, “but how could I not love God, our Creator and Benefactor? And what else is there to believe in except God’s Word in Scripture—full of truth and holiness?

“As for my neighbor, I wish them well. Why would I despise anyone? And pride—there is nothing in me to be proud of except my many sins. What could I possibly desire or covet, given my poverty and this lame leg? Surely, if I were rich or educated, then perhaps I would be guilty of what you say.”

The elder smiled sadly. “It is unfortunate, kind one, that you have not yet grasped the depth of what I say. To help you learn more quickly, I will give you a list that I follow myself when I go to confession. Read it carefully, and you will find clear and precise proof of all I have told you.”

The confessor handed me the list, and I began to read it carefully. It was titled *The Confession of the Interior Man That Leads to Humility.*

The words felt like a mirror held up to my soul:

By diligently looking within and honestly examining the state of my heart, I came to realize something difficult: I do not truly love God. I have no real love for my neighbor. I lack faith in the spiritual realities around me. And I am filled with pride and ambition.

As I studied my feelings and actions closely, I found these truths about myself:

(1) First, I do not love God.

If I truly loved Him, I would find myself thinking of Him often—and with genuine joy. Every thought of God would bring a deep delight. But the opposite is true for me. More often, I think easily and willingly about earthly things. Thoughts of God come hard, dry, and heavy.

If I loved God, then prayer would be a nourishing conversation, something that delights me and draws me deeper into communion with Him. Instead, I struggle.

Prayer feels like a burden. I am often reluctant, weakened by laziness, and I find myself ready to be distracted by any small thing—anything to shorten or even stop praying altogether.

When I am busy with empty distractions, time seems to fly by unnoticed. But when I turn my mind toward God, when I try to place myself in His presence, every hour stretches and feels like a year.

If we truly love someone, their presence fills our thoughts throughout the day. We carry their image in our minds and care deeply about them no matter what else we’re doing. A beloved friend is always near, even in the busyness of life.

But for me, I barely set aside even one hour a day to dive deeply into thoughts of God—to meditate, to open my heart, to surrender to His burning love.

Instead, I find myself spending the rest of the day—twenty-three hours!—offering my energy and attention to other idols: the distractions that inflame my passions.

Talks about worldly things, shallow and empty matters that don’t nourish the soul, often give me pleasure. But thoughts of God leave me feeling dry, bored, and lazy.

Even when others bring up spiritual topics, I’m quick to steer the conversation back toward subjects that flatter my ego or feed my curiosity about politics, news, or secular knowledge.

I’m eager to learn about sciences, arts, and material things—but when it comes to learning about God and spiritual truths, I feel indifferent. It seems almost foreign to me, a subject to explore only when I have spare time, as if it’s less important.

Yet, the Lord Jesus said clearly: *“If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.”* (John 14:23) Love for God shows itself in keeping His commandments.

And if I hardly try to follow those commandments, if I exert so little effort to live by them, then the honest conclusion is that I do not truly love God.

Saint Basil the Great echoed this truth when he said, “The proof that man does not love God and His Christ lies in not keeping His commandments.”

(2) And there’s more. I realized that I have no real love for my neighbor.

I am not just unwilling to lay down my life for another, as the Gospel teaches, but I won’t even sacrifice my honor, my happiness, or my peace for their sake.

If I loved others as I love myself, their troubles would cause me pain, and their joys would fill me with gladness.

Instead, I find myself more eager to hear bad news about my neighbor, and rather than feeling sorrow, I feel indifferent—sometimes even pleasure.

I do not cover my brother’s faults with silent love. Instead, I judge and talk about them openly.

Their well-being and happiness are not mine to rejoice in. They feel distant and alien to me. And in subtle ways, their success can even stir envy or contempt within my heart.

(3) I have no real faith in spiritual realities—not in eternal life, not truly in the Gospel.

If I were deeply convinced that life goes on beyond this world, that there is a reckoning for how I live, then I would carry that truth with me constantly.

The thought of immortality would humble and awe me. I would move through this life like a traveler passing through a foreign land, always preparing to return home.

But the truth is quite the opposite. I hardly ever think about eternity.

In my heart, I often harbor a secret doubt: *Who really knows what happens after death?*

Even when I say I believe in eternal life, it’s mostly with my mind. My heart isn’t truly convinced.

My restless actions and my endless worries about satisfying my earthly needs reveal this clearly.

If I truly believed that the Holy Gospel holds God’s own words, I would study it eagerly and with joy.

I would find delight in its wisdom, goodness, and love.

I would treasure it deeply, turning to it day and night as if it were my only sustenance.

And I would sincerely strive to live by its commandments—never letting anything in this world pull me away from it.

(4) I am filled with pride and a craving for self-importance.

All my actions reflect this inward condition. When I notice anything good in myself, I want others to see it too. I may even speak about it openly or, at the very least, admire myself inwardly.

Even when I act outwardly humble, inside I quietly take credit for what I do, believing I am better than others—or at least, not any worse.

If I notice a fault within myself, I rush to excuse it, dressing it up as something understandable or even admirable.

I grow irritated with people who don’t show me the respect I think I deserve, as if they simply lack the wisdom to recognize my worth.

I am proud of my talents, and when things don’t go my way, I take it as a personal affront.

I complain about those I resent and feel a secret pleasure when they stumble.

Even when I try to do something good, I often do it with mixed motives—seeking praise, spiritual reward, or social approval.

In truth, I’ve made an idol of myself. I constantly serve this inner false god, seeking comfort, praise, and the satisfaction of my cravings.

Looking back at all this, I see myself clearly: proud, indulgent, weak in faith, lacking in love for God, and dismissive of my neighbor.

What condition could be worse?

Even the spirits of darkness—though full of pride and hatred—at least believe in God, and tremble at His presence.

After reading this confession the priest had given me, I was shaken.

I thought to myself, *My God… what terrible things are hidden in my soul—and I had no idea!*

Seeing these truths laid bare, I felt a deep longing to be cleansed, to be healed. I turned to this wise spiritual Father, hoping he could show me the way.

And he gently began to explain:

“You see, dear brother, the reason you do not love God is because you lack faith. And the reason you lack faith is because you are not yet fully convinced. This lack of conviction comes from not seeking true, living knowledge—and from a spiritual indifference that leaves the soul untouched by the light of truth.

In short: without faith, there can be no love. Without conviction, there can be no true faith. And to become convinced, one must seek knowledge with the heart, not just the mind.

This kind of conviction is born from a desire to know—deeply and personally. And this desire awakens through reflection, through prayer, through studying the Holy Scriptures and the wisdom of the saints. It comes from listening, watching, and letting the soul grow thirsty for the things of God.

As one spiritual writer put it: *‘Love usually springs from knowledge. The deeper and more intimate the knowledge, the greater the love. The more the soul comes to see the beauty, perfection, and grace of God’s nature—and His boundless love for humanity—the more open it becomes to divine love.’*

Now you see—the root of those sins you read lies in a kind of spiritual laziness. A slowness of soul that stops us from hungering after truth. And once that hunger dies, the whole inner life withers.

If you want to be free from this, begin by kindling that hunger again. Seek out spiritual understanding. Dwell in the Scriptures. Sit with the words of the Holy Fathers. Reflect. Listen. Talk with those who walk closely with Christ. Let your heart be stirred.

Oh, dear brother—how many struggles we face simply because we neglect the nourishment of our soul! We do not meditate day and night on God’s word. We do not pray with persistence. And so our inner life grows cold, starved, and too weak to follow the path of truth with energy and joy.”

“To truly grow from all this,” the holy Father continued, “let us resolve, as often as we are able, to lift our thoughts toward heavenly things. When we set our minds on what is eternal, divine love begins to grow within us. Over time, it will become like a fire in our hearts—burning, purifying, warming everything it touches.

And alongside reflection, let us pray. Pray often, pray with your whole heart, for prayer is the most powerful way we are renewed and transformed. Nothing brings the soul back to life like prayer. Let your heart whisper the words the Church has always taught: *‘Lord, grant me to love You now, as once I loved sin itself.’*”

I listened with my whole being. And with deep gratitude, I asked this beloved Father to hear my confession and to grant me Holy Communion. After receiving the Body and Blood of Christ, I felt full—humbled and quiet, yet burning with an inward joy.

I intended to return to Kiev then, carrying this treasure of spiritual wisdom in my heart. But the kind starets had plans to visit a nearby monastery, and before he left, he invited me to remain in his hermit’s cell. “Stay here,” he said, “and give yourself fully to prayer. Let silence and stillness shape your days.”

Those few days felt like a taste of heaven.

In the quiet solitude of that simple cell, held in the prayers of my spiritual father, my soul rested in pure tranquility. Prayer flowed from my heart like a gentle river. I didn’t have to force it. It came with ease, with joy. I forgot myself completely. My thoughts were wrapped only around the sweet name of Jesus Christ. Nothing else mattered.

When the confessor returned, I asked him for counsel—where should I go next on this pilgrimage of the heart?

He smiled and said, “Why don’t you go to Pochaev? There, you may venerate the icon of the Miraculous Footstep of the All-Pure Mother of God. She will guide your steps along the path of peace.”

I received his blessing with a peaceful heart and set out for Pochaev three days later.

The road to Pochaev was long—about 130 miles—and honestly, it felt dull at times. The path stretched past taverns and clusters of Jewish settlements, but rarely did I come across familiar Christian homes or places where I could rest my heart in faith and fellowship.

So when I stumbled upon a Russian coaching inn nestled in a small village, I felt a surge of joy. At last, a place where I might rest for the night and perhaps find a bit of bread to carry on. My own little supply of crusts was wearing thin.

Inside, the innkeeper greeted me. He looked prosperous, settled—an older man with strong features. As we spoke, I was surprised to learn that he came from the same Orlovsk district I once called home.

But his first question caught me off guard.

“What faith do you belong to?”

“I’m an Orthodox Christian,” I replied simply.

The moment the words left my lips, he scoffed.

“Orthodox? That Orthodoxy of yours is nothing but words,” he said with a bitter edge. “It’s empty! I know your kind of religion. I was pulled into it once, tempted by a clever priest. I joined your church for six months. But I came back to the true faith.”

He went on, his voice laced with disappointment and a kind of wounded pride.

“What a mess it is—your services! The readers mumble through everything. They skip whole passages, speak so fast no one understands a thing. And the choirs? Just tavern singers in disguise. And the people—no reverence at all. They stand wherever they want, men and women all mixed together. They chatter through the service, fidgeting and pacing. You can’t even pray quietly!”

He looked at me, as if expecting me to agree.

“Now *our* church,” he said, “is different. The services are reverent. Everything is read clearly. The singing lifts the soul. Men and women know their places, standing apart. Everyone makes prostrations at the right time, as the Church teaches. When you enter *our* church, you feel it in your bones—you’re in the presence of God. But walk into one of yours?” He shook his head. “It’s like entering a marketplace.”

As I listened to the old innkeeper, I realized that he was an Old Believer—a member of the group that had split from the Orthodox Church over liturgical reforms. And though I disagreed with his conclusions, I had to admit—some of his critiques rang true. I couldn’t argue with him. Not really.

In my heart, I thought: how can we ever hope to bring Old Believers back into unity when our own services lack clarity and reverence? Their faith may cling to the outward forms, but those forms matter—especially when we neglect them. Until our own clergy set a better example, their hearts will remain closed to deeper truths.

With a heavy spirit, I made up my mind to move on. I had just stepped into the vestibule when something caught my eye—a narrow doorway, slightly ajar, leading to a small room. Inside, a man was lying on a bed, reading. He didn’t look like a Russian, and he beckoned me in with a wave of his hand.

“Come,” he said gently. “Tell me who you are.”

I shared my story, and he listened with kind eyes.

Then he said, “Friend, would you be willing to help a sick man—just for a week, until God grants me strength again? I am a monk from the holy Mount Athos in Greece. I came to Russia to raise support for our monastery, but on the journey back, I fell ill. My legs—so painful, I can’t even walk. That’s why I’m staying here. Please, servant of God, don’t turn me away. I will pay you.”

I smiled. “I don’t need any payment,” I said. “I’ll care for you gladly—in the Name of God.”

And so I stayed.

That week turned into a sacred blessing. He told me stories about the monks of Mount Athos—about hermits, anchorites, and great ascetics who lived hidden lives of prayer and purity. From him I learned so much. He had a Greek copy of the *Philokalia*, along with a book by Saint Isaac the Syrian. Together, we read them—comparing the Greek with the Slavonic translation done by Paissy Velichkovsky.

He had great respect for Paissy’s work. “There could be no truer or more faithful translation,” he said. And I believed him.

I noticed how constantly he prayed, how deeply he lived in the spirit of the Jesus Prayer. His heart seemed tethered to heaven. He spoke Russian fluently and generously answered all my questions about the practice of unceasing prayer.

I listened closely. I even began to write down his words—especially what he taught about the profound beauty and unmatched power of the Jesus Prayer. Here is some of what he shared with me…

One evening, as we sat quietly together, the monk began to speak of the Jesus Prayer with a light in his eyes, as though he were unwrapping a priceless treasure.

“The greatness of the Jesus Prayer,” he said softly, “is revealed even in its very structure. It has two parts—each carrying immense weight. The first part—*‘Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God’*—draws the mind into the very heart of the Gospel. In just those few words, you are holding the entire life of Christ, all that He is, all that He has done. The Holy Fathers teach that in this one phrase, the fullness of the Good News is hidden like a pearl in a shell.

“And the second part—*‘have mercy on me, a sinner’*—is the confession of our own human story. It names our weakness, our need, our deep longing for healing and redemption.

“But here is the beautiful mystery,” he said, his voice low and steady, “No soul—no matter how poor or broken—could ever express its deepest yearning more clearly than with these few words: *‘Have mercy on me.’* There’s nothing more profound.”

He paused and looked at me intently.

“Think of all the other prayers a soul might cry—*‘Forgive me!’ ‘Pardon my sins!’ ‘Wash away my guilt!’* Those are prayers born from fear—anxious cries to be spared the consequences of wrongdoing. But *‘have mercy on me’*—that comes from somewhere deeper. It’s not just fear asking to be let off the hook. It’s the loving, humble plea of a child reaching for their Father. It knows its helplessness. It longs not just for pardon, but for transformation.

“It is the prayer of one who knows: *‘I cannot fix myself. I cannot stand on my own. Only Your mercy can restore me.’* Mercy here isn’t just the canceling of a debt—it is compassion in action. It is strength for the weak. It is light for the lost. It is the grace to rise again and live.”

He grew quiet for a moment, then spoke again.

“Imagine a poor man drowning in debt. He begs not only for the debt to be forgiven, but also for the compassion of someone who sees his utter poverty and lends him a hand. That’s what this prayer does. When we say, *‘Have mercy on me,’* we are crying out: ‘O Lord, not only forgive me—but help me. Give me the strength to change. Awaken my soul. Set me on fire to live for You. Heal my wandering heart and draw it back to You alone.’”

I sat in awe, deeply moved by the wisdom that had just poured forth. The monk’s words were like a lantern in the dark, lighting up places in my heart I didn’t know were asleep. I thanked him—truly and humbly—for speaking such life into my soul. But he wasn’t finished yet.

“If you’d like,” he offered, “I can share something even more subtle—something I learned from experience and study, something many overlook.”

Of course, I wanted to hear more.

He smiled gently and said, “It’s about the way people recite the Jesus Prayer—the inflections, the musical rhythm of the soul that emerges as one speaks it aloud. You see, during my time at the Academy in Athens, we studied not only theology but the patterns of prayer and speech, the living nuances that shape the soul.”

I leaned in closer as he continued.

“I’ve had the grace of hearing many devout Christians whisper the Jesus Prayer—not only in the quiet of their homes, but in the sacred stillness of churches too. And if you listen carefully, with an open and attentive heart, you’ll notice something remarkable: each person speaks the prayer slightly differently. Their very voice reveals how their heart is encountering God.

“Some raise their voice ever so slightly at the very beginning—*‘Lord’*—like a child reaching up toward a parent. The rest of the prayer then flows in a lower, steady tone, like a stream following gravity to the depths.

“Others begin in a low, gentle murmur, but as they reach *‘Jesus,’* their tone lifts—as though their spirit is straining toward the Name that saves. Then they return again to that quiet current of the soul, letting the rest of the prayer settle like dew on the heart.

“Still others speak the entire prayer in a soft, even voice—but when they come to the final words—*‘have mercy on me’*—their pitch rises with intensity, almost to the edge of tears. It’s as if their entire being is wrapped in that one plea for mercy, bursting forth like a final cry.

“And then,” he said with a pause, “there are some who carry the prayer in a gentle monotone, but lift their voice just slightly at the words *‘Son of God.’* It’s a reverent acknowledgment—a quiet act of worship hidden in tone.”

He looked at me kindly and added, “Even in these small inflections, the soul expresses its posture before God—whether it’s awe, longing, repentance, or reverence. It’s not about performance. It’s about presence.”

The monk’s voice softened, as if he were inviting me into a holy mystery.

“Now listen carefully,” he said. “The Jesus Prayer is the same for all of us. Every Orthodox Christian professes the same faith, and we all recognize what this prayer holds: the Name of the Lord Jesus, and the plea for His mercy—for reconciliation, for healing. And yet... we each say it differently.

“Why is that? Why does one person lift their voice on *‘Lord,’* while another is stirred to raise it on *‘Jesus’* or *‘Son of God,’* or even only at the final cry of *‘have mercy on me’*? Why this diversity in something so seemingly simple and shared?

“Some might explain it in practical terms—habit, influence, personality, even the natural tone of one's voice. They might say it’s nothing more than personal style or comfort. But I believe something deeper is at work.”

He paused, letting the silence speak first.

“I believe,” he said slowly, “that what we’re hearing is not just the human voice—but the voice of the Spirit within the human heart. I believe this hidden melody, these sacred inflections, are stirred by the Holy Spirit Himself, who, as the Scriptures say, intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words.

“Even when we don’t know how to pray, the Spirit is already praying in us—guiding us, gently shaping our cry to God. And if the Holy Spirit is truly the one praying in the hearts of the faithful, then perhaps the varied tones and emphases we hear in this simple prayer are the marks of grace at work—tailored uniquely to each soul’s need.

“To one, the Spirit gives a holy fear—so they cry out *‘Lord’* with awe and trembling, overwhelmed by the grandeur of the Creator. To another, the Spirit pours out such love that they lift the name *‘Jesus’* like a flame rising from their heart. Another may be filled with unwavering faith and cling to the title *‘Son of God,’* knowing who alone can save. Still others, pierced with deep humility, weep as they whisper *‘have mercy on me, a sinner.’*

He looked at me with a light in his eyes, not from himself, but from the truth he carried.

“This,” he said, “is how grace manifests—not just in outward signs, but in the secret stirrings of the soul. That’s why the holy elders, the true lovers of Jesus, would fall into ecstasy just at the sound of His Name. Even if someone nearby merely said it in passing, their hearts would ignite with a sweetness and longing so intense, they could hardly bear it.”

The monk continued, his words unfolding like the quiet petals of a flower blooming in candlelight.

“When a soul is firm in its faith—truly unwavering in the belief that Jesus Christ is of one essence with the Father—then something begins to burn within. Each time he says *‘Son of God,’* that flame grows brighter. The words kindle and strengthen his faith, and he is no longer just repeating a title. He is affirming the living Truth—that Jesus is God.

“And the one who has been given the gift of humility… ah, that soul knows its smallness. That one says *‘have mercy on me’* not as a phrase, but as a cry from the depths. He knows his frailty, his brokenness, and leans wholly into the mercy of God. And as he speaks those final words of the prayer, he pours himself out with his whole being—trusting not in his own strength, but in the endless compassion of Christ. He is like a beggar with open hands, sustained only by the hope of divine mercy and the hatred of his own sin.”

He paused again, and I could feel that the stillness between his words was just as holy as the words themselves.

“This,” he said, “is why each person prays the same prayer in a different tone, a different rhythm, a different spirit. It is not because we are trying to be different—but because the Holy Spirit is doing something personal and particular in each of us. The inflection is a reflection of what’s being born within.”

I sat in silence, drinking in every word like water in a dry land.

“Sometimes people ask me,” he continued, “‘If the prayer is truly from the Spirit, why is it only one part of the prayer that carries such weight for each person? Why not all of it, equally radiant with ecstasy?’ And to that, I say: Who can understand the mind of God? Who can measure the mysteries of grace?”

He smiled gently.

“We are the clay, and He is the potter. And He shapes each of us according to His wisdom. Grace is not distributed mechanically, but personally—tailored to the soul’s readiness, need, and capacity. As Scripture teaches, the Spirit gives as He wills, not as we demand. Who are we to ask why the potter fashions one vessel for one purpose and another for a different one?”

I stayed with this holy man for about five days. His body, once frail, began to show signs of healing. But more than that, my own soul was being healed—touched by the light that shone through his gentle presence and words.

Those days passed as though outside of time. In that small room, it was as if the world had faded away, and only one thing mattered: the silent, loving invocation of the Name of Jesus Christ.

When we weren’t praying in silence, we spoke of only one subject—*interior prayer.* That sacred thread ran through everything. We ate little, spoke little, and yet it felt as though we had feasted on the bread of angels.

One day, a deeply devoted man came to us, his heart heavy with anger. He spoke harshly about the Jews whose towns he had passed through, upset by the wrongs he felt they had done to him—mistreatment and deceit that left him bitter. His feelings ran so deep that he cursed them, saying they didn’t deserve to live on this earth because of their stubbornness and lack of faith. At last, he confessed to a strong, almost unbearable hatred for them.

After listening quietly, my starets gently began to share his wisdom.

“My friend,” he said softly, “your anger and curses toward the Jews are misplaced. They are, like you and me, children of God. What you need is compassion, not condemnation. Pray for them instead of cursing them. The truth is, your hatred comes from not yet being rooted in God’s love. Without that deep connection, your heart is unsettled, lacking the peace that comes from quiet prayer within.

Let me share with you something from the Holy Fathers. Mark the Ascetic writes, ‘A soul united with God feels a joy so great it makes her gentle and humble, like a kind-hearted child who no longer judges anyone—neither Greek nor pagan, Jew nor sinner. She sees everyone with clear, loving eyes and rejoices for the whole world. Her heart longs for all people, whatever their background, to praise God.’ And Saint Makarios the Great of Egypt tells us that those who contemplate deeply burn with such love that they would embrace all people as if they were their own children, without separating the good from the evil.

So, my friend, having heard these teachings, I encourage you to let go of your anger. See all people and all things as held within God’s loving care. When you face offenses, begin by looking inward—ask if you can grow in patience and humility.”

After more than a week, the starets’ health was restored. I thanked him sincerely for all his wise guidance and said goodbye. He went on his way, and I continued toward the direction I had chosen.

Before long, I was nearing Pochaev. After walking about sixty-six miles, a soldier caught up with me. I asked where he was headed, and he said he was going home to the Kamenets-Podolsky district. We walked together in silence for about six and a half miles, when I noticed he was sighing deeply, weighed down by some sorrow. He looked very troubled.

Curious, I asked, “Why are you so sad?”

He hesitated at first but then said, “My friend, since you’ve noticed my grief, swear to me that you will keep this secret, and I will share my story with you. My death feels near, and I have no one else to turn to for advice.”

I assured him that, as a Christian, I held everything in confidence and was ready to offer any counsel I could, from brotherly love.

He began to speak. “I was drafted into the army from a peasant background. After five years, life became unbearable. They beat me often—for being rebellious, and for drunkenness too. So I decided to run away. It’s now been fifteen years since I deserted. For six years, I hid wherever I could, stealing from sheds and barns. I took horses, broke into shops, doing everything alone. I sold what I stole to shady people and spent the money on drink and wild living. I committed many sins, but I never caused anyone to lose their soul. Things went on like this until I was finally caught and thrown into jail for wandering without papers. But even then, I escaped at the first chance.”

“One day, unexpectedly, I met a soldier who had been honorably discharged and was making his way home to a distant province. He was very sick and barely able to walk, so he asked me to help him get to the nearest village where he could find a comfortable place to rest. I took him there, and the village policeman allowed us to spend the night on some hay in a barn.

That night, I lay down to sleep beside him, but when I woke early the next morning, I saw that he had died and was already stiff. I quickly searched his pockets for his discharge papers—and found them, along with a good amount of money. While everyone was still asleep, I slipped quietly out of the barn, through the backyard, and into the forest. That’s how I escaped.

When I looked through his papers, I saw that he was close to my age and looked much like me. That gave me courage, and I boldly set out for the faraway Astrakhan province.

There, I settled down and found work as a laborer. I connected with an old man, a commoner who owned a house and traded livestock. He was single and lived with his widowed daughter. After a year living with them, I married his daughter. Then the old man passed away.

We didn’t know how to run the business, and soon I started drinking again—and so did my wife. Within a year, we spent all the money the old man had left us. Then my wife fell ill and died too. I sold the house and everything else, and before long, I had squandered all the money.

With nothing left to live on or to eat, I went back to my old ways, stealing once more. But this time I was even bolder, because I had that passport. And so, for about another year, I lived a life of corruption again.”

I was crushed from all sides in a way that’s hard to even put into words—agony, terror, and despair gripping me tightly. It felt as if my very sinews were being torn from my body, and I was suffocating under the weight of pain. The torment was so overwhelming that I thought I might faint if it went on a moment longer.

Then, nearby, a mare kicked me and grazed my cheek, cutting it open. In that instant, jolted awake, horror filled me and I trembled uncontrollably. Around me, the light of dawn was breaking, the sun rising. I touched my cheek and felt the warm trickle of blood. The parts of my body that had been trapped under the earth in my dream felt numb and prickling, like tiny insects crawling beneath my skin.

In my panic, I barely managed to rise, and I made my way home.

“My cheek hurt for a long time, and you can see the scar now that wasn’t there before. After that vision, fear and horror often haunted me. Every time I remembered the torment from my dream, I was overwhelmed with anguish and despair. It was so intense that I didn’t know how to hold myself together.

As time went on, these feelings came more and more often, until I grew afraid of people and ashamed, as if everyone could see all my past wrongs. Eventually, the sadness became so heavy I couldn’t eat, drink, or sleep—I was just a shadow of the man I once was. At one point, I even thought about going back to my regiment to confess everything. Maybe if I were punished, God might forgive me. But I was afraid—terrified, because I knew they would make me run the gauntlet.

Unable to bear it any longer, I thought about hanging myself. But then I realized I didn’t have much time left to live anyway. I was so weak that death felt near. So I decided to go home, to say my goodbyes—there’s a nephew waiting for me there—and to die. It’s been half a year now on this journey, but the sorrow and fear still haunt me.

What do you think, good man? What should I do? I really can’t carry this burden any longer.”

After hearing all this, I was quietly filled with wonder and gratitude for how God’s grace works in so many different ways to bring sinners back to Himself. I said gently, “My friend, it is when fear and anguish feel the heaviest that you should turn to prayer. Prayer is the only true remedy for our pain.”

He replied, “But I can’t. I’m afraid that if I start praying, God will punish me right then and there.”

I smiled warmly and said, “That’s not true. Those fearful thoughts come from the enemy trying to keep you trapped. God’s mercy is boundless, especially toward those who repent. You know the Jesus Prayer—‘Lord, Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ Just keep saying it without stopping.”

He laughed softly. “How could I not know that prayer? Even when I was stealing, I said it sometimes to give myself courage.”

I said, “Then listen: God didn’t strike you down when you prayed it on your way to sin. Do you really think He would now, as you begin your path back to Him? Your doubts come from the enemy. Believe me, friend, if you pray this prayer no matter what thoughts come, you will find joy. Your fears and burdens will lift, and in time, you will know peace. Your heart will grow devoted, and your sinful passions will fade. I speak from experience, having seen this transformation many times.”

I shared with him stories of how the Jesus Prayer had worked miracles in the lives of others. Then I invited him to come with me to honor the icon of the Pochaev Mother of God, Refuge of Sinners. There, he could confess and receive Communion.

He listened carefully, and I could see a spark of joy. He agreed to everything.

We set out for Pochaev, deciding to walk in silence and pray the Jesus Prayer without ceasing. For a full twenty-four hours, we moved forward quietly. The next day, he told me he felt better—calmer than before. On the third day, we arrived in Pochaev, and I encouraged him once more to keep praying the Jesus Prayer day and night, even until sleep took him. I assured him that the Holy Name of Jesus, though unbearable to the enemy, held the power to save him.

I also read to him from the Philokalia, explaining that while we should pray the Jesus Prayer always, it is especially important to do so with care when preparing to receive Communion, the Mystical Gifts of Christ.

He took my advice right away—going to confession and then receiving Communion. Though troubling thoughts still came now and then, the Jesus Prayer quickly pushed them away. To make sure he could rise early for matins, he went to bed early that night, praying the Jesus Prayer without stopping. I sat nearby, reading my Philokalia by the soft glow of a night lamp.

After about an hour, he fell asleep. I began to pray quietly. Then, about twenty minutes later, he suddenly woke, startled, and sprang up. With tears in his eyes and joy in his voice, he said, “Ah, my friend, what I have just seen! I am filled with such bliss! Now I truly believe that God does not torment but shows mercy to sinners. Glory to You, O Lord, glory to You!”

I was filled with wonder and joy and asked him to share what he had experienced.

He said, “As soon as I fell asleep, I found myself back in that meadow where I had suffered. At first, I was afraid. But then, instead of the dark cloud, a bright sun rose, bathing the whole meadow in beautiful light. Flowers and grass blossomed all around. Suddenly, my grandfather appeared, so handsome that I couldn’t look away. With warmth and love, he quietly said, ‘Go to Zhitomir, to the Church of Saint George the Conqueror. They will hire you as a church watchman there. Live out your days in prayer, and God will be merciful to you.’ Then he made the sign of the cross over me and vanished.

I was overwhelmed with joy—words can’t describe it. It felt as though a great weight was lifted, and I soared toward heaven. When I woke, my heart was bursting with happiness.

So now, what else can I do but go straight to Zhitomir, just as my grandfather told me? And with prayer, the journey won’t be hard at all.”

“Mercy, good man! And where do you think you’re going in the middle of the night? At least stay for matins, pray, and then go with God.”

So, though we didn’t get any sleep, after our conversation we went to church. He prayed deeply and tearfully through all of matins, feeling a sweet inner joy as the Jesus Prayer flowed from his heart. Then he received Communion at the Divine Liturgy.

After lunch, I walked with him as far as the road leading to Zhitomir, where we parted with both joy and tears.

Later, I thought about where I should go next. I decided to return to Kiev, drawn by the wise counsel of my spiritual father who lived there. I hoped that while staying with him, some kind-hearted benefactors might help send me on to Jerusalem or, at least, Mount Athos.

So, after spending another week in Pochaev reflecting on my journey and recording meaningful moments, I prepared to leave. I packed my knapsack and went to church to venerate the icon of the Mother of God as a parting gesture, then planned to pray at the Liturgy before setting off.

Standing at the back of the church, a man entered who looked like a nobleman, though his clothes were a bit worn. He asked me where the candles were sold, and I showed him. After the Liturgy, I stayed to pray before the icon of the Miraculous Footstep of the Mother of God, then headed out.

A little way down the street, I noticed an open window where a barin was sitting, reading a book. It was the same man who had asked about the candles. I tipped my hat as I passed, and he called me over.

“You must be a pilgrim, am I right?” he said.

He invited me in, asked about me, and where I was going. He served me tea and said, “Listen, friend, I suggest you visit the Solovetsky Monastery. There’s a quiet, peaceful skete there called Anzersky. It’s like another Athos, and everyone is welcome. The only request is that you take turns reading the Psalms in church for about four hours a day. I’m headed there myself, traveling on foot as I vowed. We could go together—that would be safer since the road is lonely. I have money to feed us on the way. We could even walk about seven yards apart so we won’t disturb each other while we pray. Think about it, friend. Say you’ll come! It’ll be good for you, too.”

I took this unexpected invitation as a clear sign from the Mother of God, answering the prayer I had offered for guidance on where to go next. So without hesitation, I agreed immediately.

The next day, we set out together. For three days, we walked one behind the other, just as we had agreed. He carried a book he never let out of his hands, day or night. Often, he would be lost in thought, quietly turning its pages even as we paused to eat.

I noticed it was the Bible, and I asked him gently, “If I may be so bold, Batyushka, why do you never put the Bible down? Day and night, you hold it close like that.”

“Because,” he answered, “I spend almost all my time studying from it.”

I asked, “What exactly are you studying?”

He replied, “The Christian life, which is centered on prayer. I believe prayer is the heart of salvation and the essential duty of every Christian. Prayer is both the first step on the spiritual path and the highest point of a holy life. The Bible commands us to pray always and without ceasing. While other acts of devotion have their appointed times, prayer is not limited to certain hours. No good deed can be done without prayer, and true prayer can only be learned through the Bible.

That’s why those who have reached salvation through the interior life—prophets who spoke God’s words, hermits, ascetics, and all faithful Christians—were taught to pray by continually and deeply studying Scripture. Reading the Bible was their most important task. Many never let it leave their hands, and when others sought their advice on salvation, they said, ‘Sit quietly in your cell and read, and read again, the Bible.’”

I was moved by his devotion and love for prayer, and I asked, “Which specific parts of Scripture taught you about prayer?”

He answered, “All four Gospels, really. The whole New Testament, read from beginning to end. After reading and reflecting on it for a long time, I realized there is a clear progression and connection in how the Gospels teach prayer. It begins with an introduction, then moves to its form—the outward words we say. Next, it explains the conditions needed for prayer—the method of learning to pray, with examples. Finally, it reveals the deeper, mystical teaching about unceasing, interior prayer in the Name of Jesus Christ, which is higher and more fruitful than formal prayer.

After that, the Gospels explain why prayer is necessary, what fruits it bears, and more. In short, everything needed to learn how to pray is laid out carefully and systematically in the Gospels, step by step from start to finish.”

After hearing this, I asked him to show me everything in detail.

“There is nothing I enjoy more,” I said, “than speaking and hearing about prayer. I would love to see for myself this mystical order and progression you speak of. For the Lord’s sake, please show me exactly where I can find it in the Gospels.”

He gladly agreed. “Open your New Testament,” he said, handing me a pencil. “Mark everything I tell you.”

“First,” he began, “go to Matthew chapter 6, verses 5–8. There you will find the introduction to prayer—how to prepare for it. It teaches that prayer should be free from vanity, not performed in noisy places, but in seclusion and peace. It says we should pray for the forgiveness of sins and union with God, not for excessive worldly things as the pagans do.

“Then, in the same chapter, read verses 9–13. Here you find the Lord’s Prayer—the form and words to be used, containing all that is truly necessary in life.

“Next, verses 14–15 in the same chapter show the conditions for true prayer—if we do not forgive others, God will not forgive us.

“Now turn to chapter 7, verses 7–12. This teaches the right way to pray—asking, seeking, knocking with persistent hope. These words emphasize the repetitive, continual nature of prayer, showing that it should accompany all we do until it becomes the first and highest concern of our life.”

“This,” he continued, “is the chief characteristic of true prayer. You see it in Mark 14:32–40, where our Lord Himself repeats the same prayer several times. Luke gives similar examples—Luke 11:5–14 tells of the friend who is persuaded by persistence, and Luke 18:3–7 tells of the widow who wears down the unjust judge with her constant pleading. In both, Christ bids us to pray always, everywhere, and never lose heart—that is, never grow idle.

“But the Gospel of John goes still deeper. It shows the mystery of the inner prayer of the heart. First, in His conversation with the Samaritan woman (John 4:5–26), the Lord teaches that true worship must be in spirit and in truth, springing up like living water into eternal life—unceasing, inward communion with God.

“Then, in John 15:4–8, we are shown the power and necessity of this prayer: the soul abiding in Christ, holding Him in constant remembrance. And finally, in John 16:23–25, a great mystery is revealed.

“Think of it—Jesus had already taught the disciples the Our Father early on, yet before His Passion He tells them, ‘Until now you have asked nothing in My Name… whatever you ask the Father in My Name, He will give you.’ That was the missing key. Once they learned to pray in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, they worked wonders and were filled with light.

“Do you see now the perfect order and fullness in the Gospels’ teaching on prayer? And if you turn from there to the Apostles’ Epistles, you will find their further counsel on the same holy work.”

He went on:

“To finish what I’ve been telling you, let me show you the passages that speak of what must accompany prayer.

“In the Acts of the Apostles, you see how the first Christians—newly enlightened by faith in Jesus Christ—prayed with constancy and fervor \[Acts 4:31]. From this we learn not only the diligence of their prayer, but also its fruits: the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and His gifts upon those who pray. Something similar is found in Acts 16:25–26.

“Then, if you read through the Apostles’ Epistles in order, you will find:

1. The necessity of prayer in every circumstance of life —\[James 5:13–16].
2. The help of the Holy Spirit in prayer —\[Hebrews 13:20–21; Romans 8:26].
3. That one must always pray in the Spirit —\[Ephesians 6:18].
4. The importance of inner peace for prayer —\[Philippians 4:6–7].
5. The command to pray unceasingly —\[1 Thessalonians 5:17].
6. The duty to pray not only for ourselves but for all people —\[1 Timothy 2:1–5].”

“Thus,” he concluded, “when you read the Scriptures often and attentively, you begin to uncover ever deeper revelations of the mystical wisdom hidden in God’s word—treasures you would miss with only rare or casual reading. From what I’ve shown you, do you see now the wisdom and the harmony—the systematic, mystical interconnections—by which the New Testament presents our Lord Jesus Christ’s teaching on prayer? We have gone through it step by step:

“In the Gospel of Matthew, you find the preface—the introduction to prayer, its form, its conditions. In Mark, you see concrete examples. In Luke, the parables that illustrate it. In John, the mystical practice of interior prayer. And though all four Gospels contain all of these elements in varying degrees, you can see how each has its special emphasis.

“Then, in Acts, we read of the practice and fruits of prayer. And in the Apostles’ Epistles—and even in Revelation—we find conditions inseparably bound up with prayer itself. This is why I accept only the Bible as my source for learning all the ways that lead to salvation.”

As he spoke, I marked each passage in my New Testament, eager not to forget a single one. Everything he showed me seemed so remarkable and edifying that I thanked him with all my heart.

We walked on in silence for about five more days. But my companion’s feet, unused to such long journeys, began to ache terribly. In the end, he hired a cart drawn by two horses and took me along. In this way, we arrived here, planning to stay three days to rest before continuing straight to the Anzersky Skeet, which he longed to reach without delay.

**Starets:** “What a remarkable companion you have! Judging by his devotion, he must be highly educated. I would like to meet him.”

**Pilgrim:** “We are sharing an apartment. If you wish, I will bring him to you tomorrow. But for tonight—it is already too late. Forgive me!”
