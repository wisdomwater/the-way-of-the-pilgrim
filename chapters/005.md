A whole year had passed since I last saw the pilgrim. Then, at last, there was a soft knock at the door, and a gentle voice announced the arrival of that dear brother—bringing great joy to the one who had been waiting for him.

**Starets:** “Come in, beloved brother! Let us give thanks to the Lord together, who has blessed both your journey and your safe return!”

**Pilgrim:** “Glory and thanks to the Most High, the Father of all goodness, for everything He provides out of His wisdom—whatever is best for us, pilgrims and strangers in a foreign land. Here I am again, a sinner who left you last year, and by God’s mercy has been granted the joy of seeing you and hearing your kind welcome once more.

“Of course, you're expecting to hear a detailed account of the holy city of God—Jerusalem—which I longed to visit with all my heart and toward which I directed all my efforts. But as you know, not everything we desire comes to pass. That’s what happened to me—and it's no surprise. How could I, a poor sinner, be worthy to walk the sacred ground that still bears the footprints of our Lord Jesus Christ?

“You’ll remember, Father, that I left here last year with a companion—an elderly man who was deaf—and I carried a letter from a merchant in Irkutsk to his son in Odessa, asking him to help arrange passage for me to Jerusalem. Well, we made it safely to Odessa without any trouble. My companion quickly booked a spot on a ship headed for Constantinople and departed. I stayed behind and went looking for the merchant’s son, to whom the letter was addressed.

“I found his house easily, but to my deep sorrow and surprise, I learned that my benefactor had died just three weeks earlier after a short illness. He was already buried. I was grieved, but I surrendered it all to the will of God.

“The household was in mourning. His widow, who was left with three small children, was overwhelmed by sorrow—she cried constantly and fainted from grief several times a day. It looked like she might not live long either. Still, in the midst of all this, she received me kindly. Since she couldn’t send me to Jerusalem herself, she allowed me to stay as her guest for two weeks, until her late husband’s father was expected to return to Odessa to handle the family’s affairs and settle the accounts.

“So I stayed.”

I stayed with them for a week, then a month—and then another month passed. But the merchant never arrived. Instead, he sent a letter saying that due to his own difficulties, he couldn’t come. He told the family to settle all their affairs and come join him in Irkutsk as soon as possible.

That set off a whirlwind of activity as they made plans to leave. Seeing that they were now too busy to keep hosting me, I thanked them for their kind hospitality to a stranger, said my goodbyes, and continued on my journey through Russia.

For a while, I wasn’t sure where to go next. But eventually, I decided to head to Kiev, since I hadn’t been there in many years. So I set off.

At first, I was truly saddened that my dream of visiting Jerusalem hadn’t come true. But I reminded myself that even this disappointment was part of God’s divine plan. That gave me comfort. I hoped that the Lord, who loves all people, would accept the desire of my heart as though I had actually made the journey—and that He would still guide me and bless my path with spiritual fruit.

And that’s exactly what happened. Along the way, I met people who opened my eyes to things I’d never known before—people who brought light to my soul and helped it toward salvation. If events hadn’t taken this turn, I never would have crossed paths with these spiritual guides.

So I continued walking during the day with the prayer always with me, like a faithful companion. At night, I would find a place to stay and read from my *Philokalia* to strengthen my soul and keep it alert in its struggle against the unseen forces that try to pull us away from salvation.

Then, about seventy versts from Odessa, something unusual happened.

I came across a long train of wagons—about thirty carts—carrying goods. I caught up to them, and I noticed that one of the drivers, who was near the front, was walking alongside his horse. The rest of the drivers were farther back, traveling together in a group.

We came to a pond fed by cold underground springs. Because of the early spring thaw, chunks of ice were floating around its edges, crashing into each other with a loud, eerie sound.

Suddenly, the young man leading the caravan stopped his horse, which brought the whole train of carts to a halt. All the other drivers ran up to see what was going on—and there he was, beginning to take off his clothes. They asked him why, and he calmly said that he had an overwhelming urge to swim in the icy pond.

Everyone was stunned. Some laughed at him, others scolded him and called him mad. His older brother, who was also part of the group, tried to stop him and pleaded with him to get back on the road.

But the young man wouldn’t budge. He insisted on what he felt.

A few of the younger drivers, thinking it was all a joke, dipped buckets into the icy pond and splashed water on him—on his head, on his neck—saying, “There you go! Here’s your bath!”

The moment the cold water touched his body, he cried out, “Oh! How wonderful!” Then he sat down on the ground as they kept splashing him. Not long after that, he lay down—and quietly, peacefully—he died.

Everyone stood in shock, unsure of what had just happened. Some of the older men grew anxious and said they would need to report it to the authorities. Others just shook their heads and said, “It must have been his time to go.”

I stayed with the group of wagon drivers for about an hour, still trying to take in what I had just witnessed. Then I continued on my way. After walking about three and a half miles, I came to a village right off the main road.

As I entered the village, I came across an elderly priest walking down the street. I felt compelled to share the strange event I had seen, curious to hear his thoughts. The priest invited me into his home, and after I told him the whole story, I asked him if he could help me understand what had happened.

He listened quietly, then said, “Dear brother, there’s not much I can tell you for certain—only that many things in this life are mysterious and far beyond our understanding. I believe that sometimes God allows events like this to occur so that His presence and divine order in the world become more visible to us, often through what seems unnatural or sudden.”

Then the priest shared a story of his own.

“Near our village, there’s a deep, narrow ravine—very steep, at least ten sazhen deep. Just looking into it gives you chills. Somehow, a narrow pedestrian bridge was built across it.

“One day, a peasant from my parish—a good, decent man with a family—began feeling a strong, strange urge to throw himself into that ravine. He struggled with the thought for an entire week, deeply tormented by it. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore. One morning, he got up early, rushed to the ravine, and jumped off the bridge.

“People heard his cries and managed to pull him out, though it was very difficult, and both of his legs were badly broken. When they asked him why he had done such a thing, he said that even though he was in terrible pain, he felt at peace. He said that giving in to the urge that had haunted him so intensely all week had somehow quieted his soul. It was as if he had been willing to die just to find relief.”

The priest continued his story.

“The man was treated in the city hospital for over a year. I visited him there from time to time. Just like you, I hoped to hear the doctors offer some explanation for what had happened. But when I asked them, they all said the same thing—it was a case of ‘obsession.’

“I pressed them for a scientific explanation. Why do these things happen? What causes such torment in a person? But they had nothing more to offer. All they could say was that it was one of nature’s mysteries, something science doesn’t yet understand.

“So I told them, ‘If a person were to turn to God in prayer in moments like these—and if they shared their inner struggle with people who are kind and wise—then even a force as powerful as an “obsession” might lose its grip.’ It’s true—there are many things in life that simply can’t be explained.”

Evening fell while we talked, so I stayed the night. The next morning, a clerk from the district police came to ask the priest for permission to bury the man who had died in the river. He said the autopsy found no signs of insanity, and the official cause of death was listed as a sudden stroke.

“You see?” said the priest. “Even medicine had no explanation for what drove him to the water. Not everything has a clear reason.”

I thanked the priest and continued on my journey. After traveling for several days, I was worn out when I arrived at a large trading town called Byelaya Tserkov. As the sun began to set, I started looking for a place to stay the night.

In the town marketplace, I saw a man who looked like a traveler, much like myself. He was going from shop to shop, asking for directions to someone’s home. When he saw me, he came over and said, “You look like a pilgrim too. Why don’t we go together? I’m looking for a man named Yevreinov. He’s a good Christian, runs a prosperous coaching inn, and is known for welcoming pilgrims. Look, I even wrote down his address.”

I was glad to join him, and before long, we found the place.

Though the host wasn’t home at the time, his wife—a kind, elderly woman—greeted us warmly. She showed us to a cozy room in the attic where we could rest. We settled in for a bit, and after a while, the host returned and invited us to share dinner with him.

Over the meal, we got to talking—about who we were, where we’d come from. Then, somehow, the question came up: why did he have the name Yevreinov?

“The poor man was driven to despair. Then one day, he heard someone say that even the most terrible demonic visions flee at the sign of the Cross. With nothing left to lose, and as a desperate experiment, he got hold of a Cross and wore it around his neck. From that moment on, the vision stopped tormenting him.

“After that, he began secretly attending Christian churches and reading the Gospels. Over time, his heart softened. The bitterness he once held was replaced by a deep hunger for truth. Eventually, he was baptized and became a Christian, taking the name John. He left his hometown, settled here, and married. I was born his only son.

“I chose to take the surname ‘Yevreinov,’ meaning ‘son of a Jew,’ not out of shame, but to always remember the mysterious way God can reach even the hardest of hearts and bring light out of darkness. My father used to say that the suffering he went through was God’s mercy—because through it, he found truth, peace, and salvation.”

We were deeply moved by this story. As the evening wore on, we prayed together and gave thanks for the mysterious and wondrous ways God works in human lives.

After dinner, we gave thanks—both to God and to our kind host—and made our way up to the little attic room where we were staying. We weren’t quite ready to sleep yet, so we started talking.

My traveling companion shared a bit of his story. He was a merchant from Mogilets, though his heart had already begun turning toward the monastic life. For two years, he’d lived as a novice in one of the monasteries in Bessarabia, but only on a temporary passport. Now, he was heading home to get a permanent release from the merchants’ association so he could return to the monastery for good.

He spoke with such affection for the Bessarabian monasteries—the way they were run, the depth of the spiritual life there, the discipline, the wisdom of the startsi (those gentle elders who guide others in the way of prayer). He said that compared to the monasteries in Russia, it was like comparing heaven and earth. He encouraged me to go there myself.

While we were still talking, another guest arrived—a non-commissioned officer on leave from the army. He was clearly worn out from his journey, so after a short introduction and a shared prayer, we all lay down to sleep.

At daybreak, we began to pack up and get ready to continue our journey. But just as we were about to thank our host and leave, the sound of church bells rang out—calling the faithful to matins.

The merchant and I stopped in our tracks. How could we just walk away after hearing that sacred call? How could we turn our backs on the invitation to stand in God’s presence, to join the prayers of the Church? We looked at each other and quickly agreed—it would be better to attend the service first, to pray with others in the holy stillness of the temple. Then, when we left, it would feel right. Our steps would be lighter, our hearts more peaceful.

We turned to the officer and invited him to come with us. He shook his head. “Why bother?” he said. “What does it matter to God if we go to church now? I’ll pray when I get home. You go if you want—I’m heading out now. While you’re at matins, I’ll have a three-mile head start, and honestly, I can’t wait to be home.”

The merchant looked at him kindly but seriously. “Be careful, my friend,” he said. “You don’t know what the future holds. God might have something different in mind for you.”

So, the merchant and I went to church, while the officer headed out on his own. The matins service was held quite early—gentle and still, just as the day was beginning. When it ended, we walked back to our room to gather our things. But before we could even finish packing, our hostess appeared with a steaming samovar in her hands.

“And where do you think you’re going?” she said, smiling. “Here, have some tea—and stay for dinner while you’re at it. We won’t let you leave on an empty stomach!”

We couldn’t refuse such kindness. So we sat down and began sipping our tea. We hadn’t been there long—maybe half an hour—when suddenly, we saw the officer running toward us, completely out of breath.

“I’ve come to you full of grief… and joy,” he said.

Naturally, we were alarmed. “What happened?” we asked.

He caught his breath and told us the story:

“Right after I left you, I decided to stop at the inn. I needed to break a large bill and figured a quick shot of vodka would make the journey easier. I changed my money, had my drink, and set off feeling light on my feet.

“About two miles down the road, I thought I’d double-check the money—just to be sure the innkeeper hadn’t shorted me. I sat down at the side of the road, pulled out my wallet, and counted everything. It was all there. But then I reached for my passport… and it was gone. Just like that.

“I panicked. My head started spinning. Where could it be? Then it hit me—I must’ve dropped it at the inn while I was changing money. I turned right around and ran back, my mind racing with all sorts of fears: *What if it’s gone? What if someone took it? What will I do?*

“I got back and asked the innkeeper, but he just shrugged and said he hadn’t seen it. My heart sank. I started searching everywhere—around the tables, underfoot, in the corners where I’d stood.

“And would you believe it? There it was. Folded just the way I’d left it, lying in the hay and trash on the floor, trampled and filthy but still intact.

“I was so relieved I nearly cried. It was dirty, sure, and I might get a harsh punishment for how it looks—but I didn’t care. I was just grateful to have it back. At least I’d be able to get home.

“But that’s not all,” he added, wincing. “While I was running back in such a panic, I tore the skin clean off my foot on some rocks. Now I can hardly walk. I came back to tell you everything… and, well, to ask if you’ve got a bit of lard I could use on the wound.”

The merchant looked at the officer with compassion in his eyes, but he didn’t hold back his words.

“You see, my friend? This is what happens when we ignore the quiet invitations of the Spirit. You didn’t come with us to pray, even when the bells rang out like a whisper from heaven. You wanted to get ahead, to reach your destination faster—and yet, here you are, right back with us, limping and sore.

“I tried to warn you—not to rush ahead, not to assume you knew what the road would hold. And now, well... here we are.

“But more than that, it wasn’t just that you skipped church—you even said, *‘What good is it to God if we pray?’* That’s a dangerous way to think.

“No, God doesn’t need our imperfect prayers. But in His deep, unshakable love for us, He *loves* when we pray. Even the smallest prayer, even a feeble, wandering one, is precious to Him.

“It’s not only the rare and perfect moments of pure prayer—the kind the Holy Spirit breathes into our souls—that bring Him joy. No, it’s every flicker of desire, every little movement of our hearts toward Him that delights Him. He asks us to *abide in Him*, and He promises to abide in us. Every time we even *want* to respond to that call, He meets us there.

“God notices every little step we take in His direction. Every honest intention. Every whisper of love. Even the thought, *‘Maybe I’ll try to turn toward God today’*—He treasures it. And in His generosity, He pours back a thousand times more love than we ever give.

“You offer a mite, and He returns a treasure. You think of turning toward Him, and already He’s running to meet you. You whisper, *‘Have mercy on me,’* and He’s already wrapping His arms around you like a Father who’s just found His long-lost child.

“That’s the kind of love God has. That’s what makes heaven rejoice—not because we’re perfect, but because we keep turning back, again and again, however small the step.

“So don’t tell yourself it’s useless when your prayer drifts or your attention scatters. Don’t dismiss those little moments—sighing from the heart, making a small offering, resisting a temptation, bearing a slight offense in silence, or simply calling on the name of Jesus Christ. All of that matters. Every bit of it matters to God.”

“You see,” the merchant continued, “you might think these small efforts don’t amount to much. That they don’t *really* matter. But I’m telling you—they do. Not a single act of goodness, no matter how tiny or hidden, is ever wasted. Each one is seen by the loving, watchful eye of God. And each one will be honored—richly. Not only in the life to come, but even in this one.

“Saint John Chrysostom said it beautifully: *‘No good deed, however small, is ever scorned by the Righteous Judge.’* If our sins are weighed so carefully—if even our stray thoughts and words are counted—how much more will the good we do, even when it's humble and imperfect, be noticed and cherished by our all-loving Judge?

“Let me tell you a story—something I witnessed myself.

“There was a monk in Bessarabia, a good man, sincere in his faith. One day, he found himself battling a craving for dried fish. It doesn’t sound like much, does it? But for him, it was a real struggle. At the time, there was no dried fish to be found in the monastery, and the thought came to him: *Maybe I should go out to the market and get some.*

“He went back and forth with himself. On one hand, monks are called to be content with what is given—to live simply, to avoid seeking pleasure. And besides, the marketplace was full of distractions and temptations, not a place for a monk to wander.

“But the craving got the better of him. Against his better judgment, he decided to go.

“He left the monastery and started down the city street. As he walked, he suddenly realized—he didn’t have his *chotki* (his prayer rope) in hand. And right away, something stirred in him. *How can I walk through the city like this? I look like a soldier without a sword. People will see me and wonder… they might even be troubled by it.*

“Just as he was about to turn back, he reached into his pocket—and there it was. The chotki. He pulled it out, made the sign of the cross, slipped it over his fingers, and continued on his way—his mind now at peace.”

The merchant went on.

“As the monk approached the busy marketplace, he saw a horse standing near the shops, hitched to a large cart loaded with huge vats. Suddenly, something startled the horse—it bolted, hooves clattering wildly against the cobblestones. In an instant, it crashed into the monk, brushing his shoulder and knocking him hard to the ground.

“He wasn’t seriously hurt, but the shock left him breathless. And then—just two steps from where he’d fallen—the cart tipped violently, the entire load smashing into the ground with a deafening crash. The cart was reduced to splinters.

“He lay there stunned. If he’d been just a moment slower… if he’d taken just one more step… he would’ve been crushed along with it.

“Shaken, but grateful to be alive, he got up, dusted himself off, and continued on. He bought the dried fish, returned to the monastery, ate, prayed, and went to bed.

“But later that night, as he drifted into a light sleep, something remarkable happened. A dignified elder—a *starets* he didn’t recognize—appeared to him in a dream.

“‘Listen,’ the elder said gently, ‘I am the patron of this monastery. I’ve come to help you understand the lesson hidden in what happened today.

“‘Your struggle with temptation was weak. You gave in too easily, and you failed to examine your own heart deeply enough. That opened the door to danger—and the enemy took the chance to stir up trouble.

“‘But your guardian angel was watching. He stirred something in you—the memory of your *chotki*, the longing to pray. And you listened. You obeyed. You took that tiny step back toward God.

“‘And that small, almost forgotten act—that flicker of faithfulness—*saved your life*. Do you see? Can you understand now how tenderly God watches over us, and how richly He rewards even the smallest turning of the heart toward Him?’”

The monk awoke with a start—but not in his bed. He found himself kneeling on the floor, prostrate at the threshold of his cell door.

He wasted no time sharing the vision with others, including me. He wanted everyone to hear what had happened—not to bring attention to himself, but to offer a glimpse of how near God's mercy truly is, and how even the smallest gesture of love and remembrance can become a doorway to grace.

The merchant sat quietly for a moment, then let out a soft sigh.

“God’s love for us is truly beyond all measure,” he said. “Just think—something as small as pulling a *chotki* out of his pocket, slipping it over his hand, and calling on the Name of God once... that alone was enough to preserve a man’s life.

“On the grand scales of eternity, that one, tiny moment of turning toward Jesus outweighed hours and hours of hesitation, distraction, even spiritual laziness. A single whisper of the Name tipped the balance. A small act, repaid with something far greater than it seemed to deserve. A simple mite, returned with a gold coin.

“Do you see now how powerful prayer truly is? How mighty is the Name of Jesus Christ when we speak it with even a sliver of sincerity?

“In the *Philokalia*, Saint John of Karpathos says that when we pray the Jesus Prayer—*‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner’*—God’s own mystical voice responds to every cry with these words: *‘Child, your sins are forgiven.’*

“And he goes even further. He says that in that very moment of prayer, we are no different from the saints, the martyrs, and the blessed. Not because we’ve earned it, but because prayer unites us all in the presence of God. Saint John Chrysostom said the same: *‘Prayer cleanses instantly, even if it is spoken by a sinner.’*

“Such is the mercy of God! And yet, what do we so often do? We cling to our worries and distractions. We say we don’t have time. We forget God—and worse, we forget that we belong to Him. We put off prayer as if it’s optional, while filling our days with things that vanish as quickly as they come.

“And sometimes, when things fall apart and hardships come, we wonder why. But even those moments—those unexpected trials—can be used by God in His mercy to wake us up, to teach us, and to draw us closer to Him again.”

He paused, his eyes soft with feeling.

As soon as he finished speaking to the officer, I couldn’t help myself. I said to him, “Sir, you’ve filled my poor soul with such joy—I feel like bowing before your feet in thanks.”

He smiled and turned to me. “Ah, so you enjoy stories about spiritual matters, do you? Just wait a moment—I have something for you.”

He reached into his things and pulled out a small, well-worn pocketbook.

“This,” he said, “is *Agapia*, or *Salvation for Sinners*. It’s filled with stories of miraculous events—much like the one I just shared.”

The merchant pulled the small book from his pocket and carefully opened its worn cover. His eyes scanned the pages until he found the story he was looking for. Then he began to read aloud, his voice quiet and steady.

It was the story of a devout man named Agaphonik. From his earliest years, his parents had taught him to stand each day before an icon of the Mother of God and pray the ancient words: *“Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos…”* And so he did—day after day, year after year.

But as time went on, and life’s demands grew louder, his heart grew dull. He began to pray it less and less, until one day… he stopped altogether.

Then, one evening, Agaphonik welcomed a pilgrim into his home. The man told him he was a hermit from the desert of Thebaid. And with a solemn gaze, he said, “I’ve been sent to you. In a vision, I was told to come and remind you—rebuke you, really—for abandoning your prayer to the Mother of God.”

Agaphonik was surprised. “But I prayed that prayer for years,” he said. “And I never saw anything come of it. So eventually, I gave up.”

The hermit shook his head. “You’ve forgotten, haven’t you? How many times that prayer saved you, protected you, even without your knowing?

“Remember your youth—when you nearly drowned, but somehow came out safe. Remember the time a deadly plague swept through your village and so many around you died… but you stayed healthy.

“Or that time you and your friend were thrown from a carriage? He broke his leg. You didn’t even have a bruise.

“And what about that young, strong man you used to know—who’s now an invalid, while you’re still healthy and able to walk without pain?”

The hermit went on, recalling moment after moment, gently helping Agaphonik see all the quiet mercies that had followed him. Finally, he said:

“All of these—every single one—was the fruit of that simple prayer. Through it, your soul was lifted toward God, and the Most Holy Theotokos kept watch over you. Her intercession wrapped around you like a mother’s arms. So do not abandon her now. Keep praying. Keep glorifying the Queen of Heaven. For if you stop… she may no longer be there to protect you.”

When the merchant finished reading, we were called to dinner. The room was quiet for a moment—each of us taking in the story in our own way.

We ate with gratitude, thanked our host warmly, and then prepared to part ways—each of us continuing on our own journey, led by the path set before us.

I continued on foot for about five days, carrying with me the warmth of the stories I had heard from the devout merchant from Byelaya Tserkov. His words lingered in my heart like soft embers—comforting, glowing.

But as I neared Kiev, something in me shifted. I didn’t know why, but a heavy weariness came over me—both in body and in spirit. I felt drained, troubled by gloomy thoughts. My prayer grew dry, and I was swept up in a kind of spiritual laziness. It was hard to lift my soul. Hard to remember why I was walking at all.

Off to the side of the road, I noticed a wooded area and a thicket of trees. I turned from the path and wandered in, looking for a quiet place to sit—somewhere hidden, where I could rest and turn again to the *Philokalia* for strength. I hoped its words would water the withered ground of my heart.

I found a secluded spot behind a bush, and there I opened the book and began reading from the teachings of the Venerable Cassian the Roman, from part four of the *Philokalia*, on the eight thoughts that trouble the soul.

About half an hour passed, and I found myself drawn into his words—rich and nourishing. Then, as I glanced up into the forest, I noticed something strange. Not far off—perhaps a hundred paces away—I saw a man kneeling motionless in the woods. His stillness caught me. He looked deep in prayer.

The sight warmed me. I smiled to myself, thinking, *What faithful souls still walk this earth, quietly communing with God.*

I went back to my reading.

An hour passed. Maybe more. And when I looked up again, he was still there—still kneeling, perfectly still.

My heart was stirred by this silent devotion.

But then, suddenly, the man collapsed, crumpling to the ground. He didn’t move. I couldn’t see his face—he had always been turned away from me—but now I felt compelled to find out who he was, and whether he was alright.

I walked over slowly and found that he wasn’t hurt—just asleep. He lay there lightly dozing. He was a young man, maybe twenty-five years old, with a clean, pale face and soft features. He wore a simple peasant’s caftan, belted at the waist with a rope made of bast. He carried nothing with him—no bag, no staff, no belongings at all.

The sound of my steps stirred him, and he stood up quietly.

I asked who he was.

He told me he was a state peasant from the Smolensk province. He had come from Kiev and was now making his way onward.

“So where are you heading now?” I asked him.

He shrugged slightly and answered, “I don’t know. Wherever God takes me.”

I was quiet for a moment, then asked, “Has it been long since you left home?”

“Yes,” he said, “this is my fifth year.”

“And where have you stayed during that time?”

“I’ve gone to many places—holy sites, monasteries, churches. I just keep moving. There’s not much reason to stay home. I’m an orphan, no family. And my leg isn’t right—hasn’t been since I was little. So I wander.”

I looked at him, full of both compassion and respect. “It seems someone close to God must’ve guided you—not just to wander aimlessly, but to walk with purpose, visiting sacred places.”

He smiled faintly and began to tell me more.

“Well,” he said, “I grew up poor. Since I was a boy, I worked as a shepherd in our village. For about ten years everything was fine. But then one day, after I brought the herd back in, I noticed something—my village elder’s best sheep was missing. And this elder was a harsh man—mean, with no pity in him.

“When he saw the sheep was gone, he ran at me in a rage, cursing and threatening. He shouted, ‘Go find it, or I’ll beat you to death! I’ll break your arms and legs!’

“I knew he meant it—he was capable of anything. So I went out searching, retracing the places the herd had grazed. I searched into the night—past midnight. No sign of the sheep.

“It was a pitch-black night, nearly autumn. I wandered deep into the woods—thick forest, the kind that’s hard to push through in our province. Then the storm came. The trees started groaning and bending with the wind. Wolves howled in the distance. I was terrified. My whole body went cold. I thought I would faint from fear and loneliness.

“And in that moment, I dropped to my knees. I didn’t know what else to do. I made the sign of the cross over myself and cried out with all the strength I had: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.’*

“And the moment I said it, peace came over me—like a warm light filled my chest. The fear disappeared. My heart felt light—so full of joy, like I had been lifted up to heaven.

“I was so amazed, I just kept saying the prayer, over and over. And I don’t remember how long I knelt there. I don’t remember the rest of the night. The next thing I knew, the sun had risen, and I was still kneeling in the same spot.

“I stood up calmly. The sheep was gone, still, but my heart was full. I felt drawn to keep praying that little Here is the next part, lovingly adapted in the same devotional, reflective tone. Let it unfold gently, as if you're sitting with these two pilgrims by candlelight:

---

“As soon as I got back to the village,” the young man continued, “the elder saw that I had come home without his sheep. And without a word, he beat me—so badly that he twisted my leg. I was left nearly lifeless.

“For six weeks, I lay barely able to move. But even then, I kept repeating that little prayer: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.’* It was the only thing that brought me comfort. I’d whisper it through the pain, and somehow it gave me strength.

“Eventually I healed a little, enough to walk again, though my leg was never the same. And when I could, I left the village and began to roam the world. I didn’t like being around people too much—they talk too much, and there’s so much sin and noise. So I started making pilgrimages to holy places. When I wasn’t in a monastery, I wandered through the forests alone.

“This is now the fifth year of that life.”

As he spoke, my heart filled with joy—deep, holy joy—that the Lord had allowed me to meet such a man. Grace radiated from him, quiet and unpretentious. I looked at him with warmth and asked, “And now? Do you still keep praying that prayer constantly?”

He nodded, almost smiling. “I couldn’t live without it,” he said. “Whenever I remember how I felt that night in the forest, it’s like something nudges me, and I fall to my knees. I just start to pray without thinking.

“I don’t know if my sinful prayer is any good. But sometimes, when I pray, I feel this joy—I don’t know where it comes from. Like something inside me becomes free. There’s this happy peace, like everything’s okay, even if nothing looks different.

“But other times, I feel tired. Bored. Even a little depressed. Still, I want to pray. I always want to pray—until I die.”

I leaned closer and said gently, “Do not be confused, kind brother. All of it is pleasing to God. All of it is part of your salvation.

“The Holy Fathers teach us that whatever happens during prayer—joy or dryness, freedom or struggle—it is all good. Nothing is wasted in prayer. No effort, no word, no breath is lost before God.

“When you feel inner freedom, spiritual sweetness, or a strong desire to pray—this is God rewarding your effort. He’s encouraging you with comfort and grace.

“But when you feel tired, numb, or spiritually dry—this too is from God. He is purifying your soul. He is strengthening you through patience. And through humility, He is preparing you to receive even greater sweetness when the time is right.

“Here, let me show you,” I said, reaching for my book. “Let’s read from Saint John of the Ladder together.”

I found the passage I was looking for and read it aloud to him. He listened with quiet attention and seemed deeply moved. When I finished, he looked at me with gratitude in his eyes and thanked me again and again.

Then, without another word, he turned and walked back into the forest—disappearing into the trees like a bird returning to its nest. I stood there a while, watching him go. My heart was full. I turned back to the road and resumed my own journey, giving thanks to God, who had seen fit to bless a sinner like me with such a holy encounter.

By God's grace, I reached Kiev the next day. And the moment I entered that sacred city, my first desire was clear: I wanted to fast, to confess my sins, and to receive the Holy Mysteries of Christ in this blessed place. Everything else felt secondary. My soul longed for cleansing and communion.

I found lodging near the holy relics of the saints, so I could easily attend church services. A kind old Cossack took me in. He lived alone in a small hut, and it was a quiet, peaceful place—just what I needed for prayer and reflection.

As the week of preparation for confession unfolded, I resolved to make a full and honest confession. I wanted nothing left in the shadows. I turned my mind back over the years of my life, sifting through my memories. I tried to remember every sin, no matter how small.

To help myself, I began writing everything down. Every word, every deed that had grieved my conscience, I recorded. By the end, the list was long—far longer than I had expected. But I felt lighter, just for having named the truth.

Then I remembered something I had heard: about four and a half miles outside of Kiev, in the quiet Kitayev Hermitage, lived a spiritual father known for his deep wisdom and quiet holiness. People said he lived an ascetic life and possessed profound discernment. Anyone who spoke with him left changed—comforted, instructed, and spiritually renewed.

I was filled with joy at the thought of meeting this holy elder, and without hesitation, I went to see him. We spoke at length, and then I handed him my long list of sins.

He read through it carefully, then looked at me with kind but serious eyes.

“You, dear brother, have written many empty words,” he said gently. “Listen closely to what I must tell you:

First, you should not confess sins again that you have already repented of and have been absolved for, and which you have not repeated. To do so shows a lack of trust in the power of Confession itself.

Second, when confessing, do not bring up others involved in your sins. Confess only your own failings.

Third, the Holy Fathers warn us not to confess sins in excessive detail or with insinuations. Speak of them in general terms—too much personal scrutiny can lead both you and your confessor into temptation.

Fourth, you say you have come to repent, but you are not truly repentant for *not knowing how to repent.* Your repentance feels cold and careless.

Fifth, though you have listed many trivial things, you have missed the most important ones. You have not acknowledged that you do not love God as you ought; that you despise your neighbor; that you doubt the words of Scripture; and that pride and ambition fill your heart.

“Understand this: the abyss of evil and all spiritual corruption springs from these four roots. From them, all sinful shoots grow.”

I was taken aback. “Forgive me, Venerable Father,” I said, “but how could I not love God, our Creator and Benefactor? And what else is there to believe in except God’s Word in Scripture—full of truth and holiness?

“As for my neighbor, I wish them well. Why would I despise anyone? And pride—there is nothing in me to be proud of except my many sins. What could I possibly desire or covet, given my poverty and this lame leg? Surely, if I were rich or educated, then perhaps I would be guilty of what you say.”

The elder smiled sadly. “It is unfortunate, kind one, that you have not yet grasped the depth of what I say. To help you learn more quickly, I will give you a list that I follow myself when I go to confession. Read it carefully, and you will find clear and precise proof of all I have told you.”

The confessor handed me the list, and I began to read it carefully. It was titled *The Confession of the Interior Man That Leads to Humility.*

The words felt like a mirror held up to my soul:

By diligently looking within and honestly examining the state of my heart, I came to realize something difficult: I do not truly love God. I have no real love for my neighbor. I lack faith in the spiritual realities around me. And I am filled with pride and ambition.

As I studied my feelings and actions closely, I found these truths about myself:

(1) First, I do not love God.

If I truly loved Him, I would find myself thinking of Him often—and with genuine joy. Every thought of God would bring a deep delight. But the opposite is true for me. More often, I think easily and willingly about earthly things. Thoughts of God come hard, dry, and heavy.

If I loved God, then prayer would be a nourishing conversation, something that delights me and draws me deeper into communion with Him. Instead, I struggle.

Prayer feels like a burden. I am often reluctant, weakened by laziness, and I find myself ready to be distracted by any small thing—anything to shorten or even stop praying altogether.

When I am busy with empty distractions, time seems to fly by unnoticed. But when I turn my mind toward God, when I try to place myself in His presence, every hour stretches and feels like a year.

If we truly love someone, their presence fills our thoughts throughout the day. We carry their image in our minds and care deeply about them no matter what else we’re doing. A beloved friend is always near, even in the busyness of life.

But for me, I barely set aside even one hour a day to dive deeply into thoughts of God—to meditate, to open my heart, to surrender to His burning love.

Instead, I find myself spending the rest of the day—twenty-three hours!—offering my energy and attention to other idols: the distractions that inflame my passions.

Talks about worldly things, shallow and empty matters that don’t nourish the soul, often give me pleasure. But thoughts of God leave me feeling dry, bored, and lazy.

Even when others bring up spiritual topics, I’m quick to steer the conversation back toward subjects that flatter my ego or feed my curiosity about politics, news, or secular knowledge.

I’m eager to learn about sciences, arts, and material things—but when it comes to learning about God and spiritual truths, I feel indifferent. It seems almost foreign to me, a subject to explore only when I have spare time, as if it’s less important.

Yet, the Lord Jesus said clearly: *“If anyone loves me, he will keep my word.”* (John 14:23) Love for God shows itself in keeping His commandments.

And if I hardly try to follow those commandments, if I exert so little effort to live by them, then the honest conclusion is that I do not truly love God.

Saint Basil the Great echoed this truth when he said, “The proof that man does not love God and His Christ lies in not keeping His commandments.”

(2) And there’s more. I realized that I have no real love for my neighbor.

I am not just unwilling to lay down my life for another, as the Gospel teaches, but I won’t even sacrifice my honor, my happiness, or my peace for their sake.

If I loved others as I love myself, their troubles would cause me pain, and their joys would fill me with gladness.

Instead, I find myself more eager to hear bad news about my neighbor, and rather than feeling sorrow, I feel indifferent—sometimes even pleasure.

I do not cover my brother’s faults with silent love. Instead, I judge and talk about them openly.

Their well-being and happiness are not mine to rejoice in. They feel distant and alien to me. And in subtle ways, their success can even stir envy or contempt within my heart.

(3) I have no real faith in spiritual realities—not in eternal life, not truly in the Gospel.

If I were deeply convinced that life goes on beyond this world, that there is a reckoning for how I live, then I would carry that truth with me constantly.

The thought of immortality would humble and awe me. I would move through this life like a traveler passing through a foreign land, always preparing to return home.

But the truth is quite the opposite. I hardly ever think about eternity.

In my heart, I often harbor a secret doubt: *Who really knows what happens after death?*

Even when I say I believe in eternal life, it’s mostly with my mind. My heart isn’t truly convinced.

My restless actions and my endless worries about satisfying my earthly needs reveal this clearly.

If I truly believed that the Holy Gospel holds God’s own words, I would study it eagerly and with joy.

I would find delight in its wisdom, goodness, and love.

I would treasure it deeply, turning to it day and night as if it were my only sustenance.

And I would sincerely strive to live by its commandments—never letting anything in this world pull me away from it.
