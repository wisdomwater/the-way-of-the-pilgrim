A whole year had passed since I last saw the pilgrim. Then, at last, there was a soft knock at the door, and a gentle voice announced the arrival of that dear brother—bringing great joy to the one who had been waiting for him.

**Starets:** “Come in, beloved brother! Let us give thanks to the Lord together, who has blessed both your journey and your safe return!”

**Pilgrim:** “Glory and thanks to the Most High, the Father of all goodness, for everything He provides out of His wisdom—whatever is best for us, pilgrims and strangers in a foreign land. Here I am again, a sinner who left you last year, and by God’s mercy has been granted the joy of seeing you and hearing your kind welcome once more.

“Of course, you're expecting to hear a detailed account of the holy city of God—Jerusalem—which I longed to visit with all my heart and toward which I directed all my efforts. But as you know, not everything we desire comes to pass. That’s what happened to me—and it's no surprise. How could I, a poor sinner, be worthy to walk the sacred ground that still bears the footprints of our Lord Jesus Christ?

“You’ll remember, Father, that I left here last year with a companion—an elderly man who was deaf—and I carried a letter from a merchant in Irkutsk to his son in Odessa, asking him to help arrange passage for me to Jerusalem. Well, we made it safely to Odessa without any trouble. My companion quickly booked a spot on a ship headed for Constantinople and departed. I stayed behind and went looking for the merchant’s son, to whom the letter was addressed.

“I found his house easily, but to my deep sorrow and surprise, I learned that my benefactor had died just three weeks earlier after a short illness. He was already buried. I was grieved, but I surrendered it all to the will of God.

“The household was in mourning. His widow, who was left with three small children, was overwhelmed by sorrow—she cried constantly and fainted from grief several times a day. It looked like she might not live long either. Still, in the midst of all this, she received me kindly. Since she couldn’t send me to Jerusalem herself, she allowed me to stay as her guest for two weeks, until her late husband’s father was expected to return to Odessa to handle the family’s affairs and settle the accounts.

“So I stayed.”

I stayed with them for a week, then a month—and then another month passed. But the merchant never arrived. Instead, he sent a letter saying that due to his own difficulties, he couldn’t come. He told the family to settle all their affairs and come join him in Irkutsk as soon as possible.

That set off a whirlwind of activity as they made plans to leave. Seeing that they were now too busy to keep hosting me, I thanked them for their kind hospitality to a stranger, said my goodbyes, and continued on my journey through Russia.

For a while, I wasn’t sure where to go next. But eventually, I decided to head to Kiev, since I hadn’t been there in many years. So I set off.

At first, I was truly saddened that my dream of visiting Jerusalem hadn’t come true. But I reminded myself that even this disappointment was part of God’s divine plan. That gave me comfort. I hoped that the Lord, who loves all people, would accept the desire of my heart as though I had actually made the journey—and that He would still guide me and bless my path with spiritual fruit.

And that’s exactly what happened. Along the way, I met people who opened my eyes to things I’d never known before—people who brought light to my soul and helped it toward salvation. If events hadn’t taken this turn, I never would have crossed paths with these spiritual guides.

So I continued walking during the day with the prayer always with me, like a faithful companion. At night, I would find a place to stay and read from my *Philokalia* to strengthen my soul and keep it alert in its struggle against the unseen forces that try to pull us away from salvation.

Then, about seventy versts from Odessa, something unusual happened.

I came across a long train of wagons—about thirty carts—carrying goods. I caught up to them, and I noticed that one of the drivers, who was near the front, was walking alongside his horse. The rest of the drivers were farther back, traveling together in a group.

We came to a pond fed by cold underground springs. Because of the early spring thaw, chunks of ice were floating around its edges, crashing into each other with a loud, eerie sound.

Suddenly, the young man leading the caravan stopped his horse, which brought the whole train of carts to a halt. All the other drivers ran up to see what was going on—and there he was, beginning to take off his clothes. They asked him why, and he calmly said that he had an overwhelming urge to swim in the icy pond.

Everyone was stunned. Some laughed at him, others scolded him and called him mad. His older brother, who was also part of the group, tried to stop him and pleaded with him to get back on the road.

But the young man wouldn’t budge. He insisted on what he felt.

A few of the younger drivers, thinking it was all a joke, dipped buckets into the icy pond and splashed water on him—on his head, on his neck—saying, “There you go! Here’s your bath!”

The moment the cold water touched his body, he cried out, “Oh! How wonderful!” Then he sat down on the ground as they kept splashing him. Not long after that, he lay down—and quietly, peacefully—he died.

Everyone stood in shock, unsure of what had just happened. Some of the older men grew anxious and said they would need to report it to the authorities. Others just shook their heads and said, “It must have been his time to go.”

I stayed with the group of wagon drivers for about an hour, still trying to take in what I had just witnessed. Then I continued on my way. After walking about three and a half miles, I came to a village right off the main road.

As I entered the village, I came across an elderly priest walking down the street. I felt compelled to share the strange event I had seen, curious to hear his thoughts. The priest invited me into his home, and after I told him the whole story, I asked him if he could help me understand what had happened.

He listened quietly, then said, “Dear brother, there’s not much I can tell you for certain—only that many things in this life are mysterious and far beyond our understanding. I believe that sometimes God allows events like this to occur so that His presence and divine order in the world become more visible to us, often through what seems unnatural or sudden.”

Then the priest shared a story of his own.

“Near our village, there’s a deep, narrow ravine—very steep, at least ten sazhen deep. Just looking into it gives you chills. Somehow, a narrow pedestrian bridge was built across it.

“One day, a peasant from my parish—a good, decent man with a family—began feeling a strong, strange urge to throw himself into that ravine. He struggled with the thought for an entire week, deeply tormented by it. Finally, he couldn’t take it anymore. One morning, he got up early, rushed to the ravine, and jumped off the bridge.

“People heard his cries and managed to pull him out, though it was very difficult, and both of his legs were badly broken. When they asked him why he had done such a thing, he said that even though he was in terrible pain, he felt at peace. He said that giving in to the urge that had haunted him so intensely all week had somehow quieted his soul. It was as if he had been willing to die just to find relief.”

The priest continued his story.

“The man was treated in the city hospital for over a year. I visited him there from time to time. Just like you, I hoped to hear the doctors offer some explanation for what had happened. But when I asked them, they all said the same thing—it was a case of ‘obsession.’

“I pressed them for a scientific explanation. Why do these things happen? What causes such torment in a person? But they had nothing more to offer. All they could say was that it was one of nature’s mysteries, something science doesn’t yet understand.

“So I told them, ‘If a person were to turn to God in prayer in moments like these—and if they shared their inner struggle with people who are kind and wise—then even a force as powerful as an “obsession” might lose its grip.’ It’s true—there are many things in life that simply can’t be explained.”

Evening fell while we talked, so I stayed the night. The next morning, a clerk from the district police came to ask the priest for permission to bury the man who had died in the river. He said the autopsy found no signs of insanity, and the official cause of death was listed as a sudden stroke.

“You see?” said the priest. “Even medicine had no explanation for what drove him to the water. Not everything has a clear reason.”

I thanked the priest and continued on my journey. After traveling for several days, I was worn out when I arrived at a large trading town called Byelaya Tserkov. As the sun began to set, I started looking for a place to stay the night.

In the town marketplace, I saw a man who looked like a traveler, much like myself. He was going from shop to shop, asking for directions to someone’s home. When he saw me, he came over and said, “You look like a pilgrim too. Why don’t we go together? I’m looking for a man named Yevreinov. He’s a good Christian, runs a prosperous coaching inn, and is known for welcoming pilgrims. Look, I even wrote down his address.”

I was glad to join him, and before long, we found the place.

Though the host wasn’t home at the time, his wife—a kind, elderly woman—greeted us warmly. She showed us to a cozy room in the attic where we could rest. We settled in for a bit, and after a while, the host returned and invited us to share dinner with him.

Over the meal, we got to talking—about who we were, where we’d come from. Then, somehow, the question came up: why did he have the name Yevreinov?

“The poor man was driven to despair. Then one day, he heard someone say that even the most terrible demonic visions flee at the sign of the Cross. With nothing left to lose, and as a desperate experiment, he got hold of a Cross and wore it around his neck. From that moment on, the vision stopped tormenting him.

“After that, he began secretly attending Christian churches and reading the Gospels. Over time, his heart softened. The bitterness he once held was replaced by a deep hunger for truth. Eventually, he was baptized and became a Christian, taking the name John. He left his hometown, settled here, and married. I was born his only son.

“I chose to take the surname ‘Yevreinov,’ meaning ‘son of a Jew,’ not out of shame, but to always remember the mysterious way God can reach even the hardest of hearts and bring light out of darkness. My father used to say that the suffering he went through was God’s mercy—because through it, he found truth, peace, and salvation.”

We were deeply moved by this story. As the evening wore on, we prayed together and gave thanks for the mysterious and wondrous ways God works in human lives.

After dinner, we gave thanks—both to God and to our kind host—and made our way up to the little attic room where we were staying. We weren’t quite ready to sleep yet, so we started talking.

My traveling companion shared a bit of his story. He was a merchant from Mogilets, though his heart had already begun turning toward the monastic life. For two years, he’d lived as a novice in one of the monasteries in Bessarabia, but only on a temporary passport. Now, he was heading home to get a permanent release from the merchants’ association so he could return to the monastery for good.

He spoke with such affection for the Bessarabian monasteries—the way they were run, the depth of the spiritual life there, the discipline, the wisdom of the startsi (those gentle elders who guide others in the way of prayer). He said that compared to the monasteries in Russia, it was like comparing heaven and earth. He encouraged me to go there myself.

While we were still talking, another guest arrived—a non-commissioned officer on leave from the army. He was clearly worn out from his journey, so after a short introduction and a shared prayer, we all lay down to sleep.

At daybreak, we began to pack up and get ready to continue our journey. But just as we were about to thank our host and leave, the sound of church bells rang out—calling the faithful to matins.

The merchant and I stopped in our tracks. How could we just walk away after hearing that sacred call? How could we turn our backs on the invitation to stand in God’s presence, to join the prayers of the Church? We looked at each other and quickly agreed—it would be better to attend the service first, to pray with others in the holy stillness of the temple. Then, when we left, it would feel right. Our steps would be lighter, our hearts more peaceful.

We turned to the officer and invited him to come with us. He shook his head. “Why bother?” he said. “What does it matter to God if we go to church now? I’ll pray when I get home. You go if you want—I’m heading out now. While you’re at matins, I’ll have a three-mile head start, and honestly, I can’t wait to be home.”

The merchant looked at him kindly but seriously. “Be careful, my friend,” he said. “You don’t know what the future holds. God might have something different in mind for you.”

So, the merchant and I went to church, while the officer headed out on his own. The matins service was held quite early—gentle and still, just as the day was beginning. When it ended, we walked back to our room to gather our things. But before we could even finish packing, our hostess appeared with a steaming samovar in her hands.

“And where do you think you’re going?” she said, smiling. “Here, have some tea—and stay for dinner while you’re at it. We won’t let you leave on an empty stomach!”

We couldn’t refuse such kindness. So we sat down and began sipping our tea. We hadn’t been there long—maybe half an hour—when suddenly, we saw the officer running toward us, completely out of breath.

“I’ve come to you full of grief… and joy,” he said.

Naturally, we were alarmed. “What happened?” we asked.

He caught his breath and told us the story:

“Right after I left you, I decided to stop at the inn. I needed to break a large bill and figured a quick shot of vodka would make the journey easier. I changed my money, had my drink, and set off feeling light on my feet.

“About two miles down the road, I thought I’d double-check the money—just to be sure the innkeeper hadn’t shorted me. I sat down at the side of the road, pulled out my wallet, and counted everything. It was all there. But then I reached for my passport… and it was gone. Just like that.

“I panicked. My head started spinning. Where could it be? Then it hit me—I must’ve dropped it at the inn while I was changing money. I turned right around and ran back, my mind racing with all sorts of fears: *What if it’s gone? What if someone took it? What will I do?*

“I got back and asked the innkeeper, but he just shrugged and said he hadn’t seen it. My heart sank. I started searching everywhere—around the tables, underfoot, in the corners where I’d stood.

“And would you believe it? There it was. Folded just the way I’d left it, lying in the hay and trash on the floor, trampled and filthy but still intact.

“I was so relieved I nearly cried. It was dirty, sure, and I might get a harsh punishment for how it looks—but I didn’t care. I was just grateful to have it back. At least I’d be able to get home.

“But that’s not all,” he added, wincing. “While I was running back in such a panic, I tore the skin clean off my foot on some rocks. Now I can hardly walk. I came back to tell you everything… and, well, to ask if you’ve got a bit of lard I could use on the wound.”
