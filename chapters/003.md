Just before leaving Irkutsk, I went to visit my spiritual father—someone I had often spoken with during my time there. I said to him, “Well, Father, here I am, about to begin my journey to Jerusalem. I came to say goodbye and to thank you for the love and kindness you’ve shown to me, an unworthy pilgrim.”

He gave me his blessing and said, “May God guide your steps. But you know, you’ve told me much about your travels, yet very little about yourself. Who are you? Where are you from? I would be grateful to know more about your life before you began this pilgrimage.”

“Of course,” I replied. “I’d be glad to tell you. My story isn’t very long.”

I began to share. “I was born in a small village in the Orlovsk province. After my parents died, there were only two of us left—my older brother and me. He was ten years old, and I was just about three. Our grandfather took us in and raised us. He was an honest and generous man who kept an inn on the main road, and many travelers stayed there, thanks to his hospitality.

“My brother was spirited and full of mischief. He spent most of his time out running around the village, while I stayed close to our grandfather. On feast days we would go to church with him, and at home he often read aloud from the Holy Scriptures—this very Bible I now carry with me.

“When I was seven, my brother began to take a dark turn. He started drinking heavily, and it seemed something had gone wrong deep inside him. I remember one evening very clearly: we were lying together on the stove bed when, without warning, he pushed me off. I fell hard and injured my left arm. From that day on, I lost all use of it. Over time, it withered completely.”

“Grandfather realized early on that I wouldn’t be able to work in the fields like other boys. So instead, he began to teach me to read and write. Since we didn’t have any schoolbooks or grammar guides, he used what we had—this very Bible I still carry with me. He started right at the beginning, pointing out words and having me copy them so I could learn my letters. I’m not sure how I did it, but by repeating what he taught me, I eventually learned to read.

As his eyesight faded, he asked me to read aloud to him more often, correcting me gently as I went. It became a holy rhythm in our life.

There was a county clerk who used to stay at our inn from time to time. I admired his beautiful handwriting and watched him closely as he wrote. Seeing my interest, he offered to teach me. He brought me paper, ink, and even sharpened quills for me. That’s how I learned to write.

Grandfather was delighted. “Now that God has revealed reading and writing to you,” he said, “you’ll make something of yourself. Always thank the Lord for this and pray often.” So we did. We never missed a church service, and we prayed at home too. I would chant, “Have mercy on me, O God,” while Grandfather and Grandmother knelt or made prostrations.

When I turned seventeen, Grandmother passed away. Grandfather said to me, “We no longer have a woman to run the house. Your older brother has gone his own way and cannot be relied on. I want you to marry.”

I hesitated, ashamed of my withered arm, but Grandfather insisted. He found a kind, mature young woman—just twenty years old—and we were married.

A year later, Grandfather fell seriously ill. As he lay dying, he called me to his side and gave me his final blessing.

“My son,” he said, “I leave you this house and everything I have. Live with honesty. Don’t cheat anyone, and above all, pray to God—for everything in life comes from Him. Don’t put your trust in people or riches, but only in the Lord. Go to church, read the Bible, and remember me and your grandmother in your prayers. I am giving you one thousand rubles. Use it wisely. Don’t waste it, but don’t be stingy either. Give to God’s Church, and share with those in need.”

“So Grandfather passed away, and I buried him with reverence. Not long after, my brother became jealous and bitter. He resented that I had inherited the inn and everything else Grandfather had left behind. His heart grew dark with envy—and in time, his anger led him to a terrible act.

One night, while we were sleeping and there were no guests at the inn, he broke into the storage room where I kept the money, stole it, and set the place on fire. By the time we awoke, the flames had already spread throughout the house. We barely escaped with our lives, climbing out the window in nothing but our nightclothes.

By God’s mercy, we had kept the Bible under our pillows, so we were able to save it. As we stood outside, watching the house burn to the ground, we said to each other, ‘Thank God—we saved the Bible. At least we have something to comfort us in our sorrow.’ Everything else was gone. Later, we heard that my brother had fallen into drunkenness and was even bragging about how he had taken the money and burned the inn down.

We were left with nothing. No clothes, not even a pair of *lapti* to put on our feet. By the grace of God and the kindness of others, we were able to borrow enough to build a small hut and live as landless peasants.

My wife had a gift for handiwork. She spun, sewed, and wove cloth with incredible skill. She took in work from others, laboring day and night to support both of us. My withered arm made me almost useless for work, so I would sit beside her while she spun thread, and I would read aloud from the Bible. She listened quietly, and sometimes tears would stream down her face.

‘Why are you crying?’ I asked her once.

‘The words are so beautiful,’ she said. ‘They pierce my heart.’”

“Remembering Grandfather’s words, we fasted often and prayed the *akathist* to the Mother of God every morning. Each night before sleep, we made a thousand prostrations, so as not to fall into temptation. We lived like this in peace for two years.

What’s striking is that we had never heard of the prayer of the heart—we didn’t understand it at all. We simply prayed aloud, repeating words without much comprehension, making our prostrations like clumsy children doing somersaults. Yet even in our simplicity, we had a strong desire to pray. Somehow, it came naturally to say long prayers with joy, even if our minds didn’t grasp them fully.

It seems my old teacher was right: the soul can pray secretly within itself, even without our conscious awareness. Something in us awakens—an inner longing for God—that matches each person’s understanding and ability.

Then, after those two years, my wife suddenly became very ill with a raging fever. She received Holy Communion and passed away on the ninth day of her illness. I was left completely alone, without any way to support myself.

I began to beg, though I felt ashamed. But more than anything, I was drowning in grief. I didn’t know how to live without her. Whenever I walked into the cabin and saw her clothing or one of her kerchiefs, it pierced my heart like a knife. I would cry out loud and sometimes even faint. Eventually, the grief became unbearable.

I sold the hut for twenty rubles and gave away our remaining belongings to the poor. I was granted a permanent disability passport because of my withered arm. I took my Bible and left, with no particular place in mind.

‘Where should I go now?’ I wondered. And then the thought came: *I’ll go to Kiev and venerate the relics of God’s saints. I’ll ask for their help and prayers.* The moment I decided this, I felt peace return to me. My journey to Kiev was full of consolation.

That was thirteen years ago. Since then, I have wandered many places. I’ve visited countless churches and monasteries. But these days I mostly keep to the open steppes and empty fields. I don’t know whether the Lord will truly allow me to reach the holy city of Jerusalem. Perhaps, if it is His will, that sacred place will be where my sinful bones are finally laid to rest.”

“How old are you now?” my spiritual father asked.

“I’m thirty-three.”

“The age of Jesus Christ at His death.”
