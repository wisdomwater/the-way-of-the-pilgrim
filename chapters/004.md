> *But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord God my refuge…*
> —Psalm 73:28

When I came to visit my spiritual father, I said,
“How true it is, what the old Russian proverb says: *‘Man proposes, but God disposes.’*
I had every intention of leaving today, beginning my journey to the holy city of Jerusalem. But something entirely unexpected happened. A small event—completely unforeseen—has kept me here for three more days. And I couldn’t resist coming to see you, Father, to ask your advice about how to handle it. Let me tell you what happened.

After I had said my farewells and entrusted myself to God, I set out with a light heart. But just as I was passing through the city gates, I saw a familiar face standing in the doorway of the last house. It was a fellow pilgrim—someone I hadn’t seen in three years. We greeted each other warmly, and he asked where I was headed.

“I’m hoping to reach old Jerusalem, God willing,” I replied.

“Thank God!” he said. “I know the perfect traveling companion for you!”

“God bless you and him,” I said, “but surely you remember—I’ve never traveled with companions. I’m used to walking alone.”

“Yes, yes, I know,” he said. “But listen—this companion would suit you perfectly. You see, I work in this very house, and the father of the master has also made a vow to visit Jerusalem. He’s a good man—older, humble, a bit deaf. In fact, he’s *very* deaf. You could shout your head off and he wouldn’t hear a thing. If you need to speak to him, you’d have to write it down on paper. So you won’t be bothered by chatter—he hardly talks at home either. But he could really use your help on the road.”

He went on, “His son is giving him a horse and wagon for the journey to Odessa. From there, he’ll sell both and continue on by ship. The old man wants to walk most of the way, but he needs the wagon for his belongings and a few gifts he’s bringing to the Lord’s tomb. You could even load your own knapsack onto the wagon—just think of it! And how could you let an old, deaf man go off all by himself on such a long road? It’s dangerous. He’s carrying some money and parcels, and we’ve been trying to find someone trustworthy to accompany him. But everyone wants too much in return—and none of them are right. You would be just the person. I’ll vouch for you to his family, and they’ll be thrilled. They’re good people. They care for me, and I’ve worked for them these past two years.”

We had been talking at the doorway, but then he brought me inside and introduced me to the master of the house. Right away, I could tell this was a good, honest family—humble, generous, full of decency. So I agreed to their offer. We planned to set out, God willing, on the third day after Christmas, right after the Divine Liturgy.

Isn’t it something how these unexpected turns happen in life? And yet, in all of it, God’s hand gently steers our course. As the Scriptures say, *“For God is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure”* (Philippians 2:13).

When I finished telling this story, my spiritual father smiled and said,
“I rejoice with all my heart, dear brother, that the Lord has let me see you again—so soon, and so unexpectedly! Since you still have some time before your journey, I ask you, lovingly, to stay a little longer. Tell me more about the spiritual lessons you’ve received during your long pilgrimage. I’ve listened with such delight to your stories.”

“I would be glad to,” I replied. And so I began to share again.

So many things have happened to me—both joyful and sorrowful—that I could never recount them all. Some I’ve even forgotten. My heart was always more drawn toward whatever awakened my lazy soul to prayer. The rest, I tried to leave behind. As the apostle Paul says, *“forgetting what lies behind and striving forward to what lies ahead”* (Philippians 3:13).

Even my blessed starets, of holy memory, used to teach that the greatest obstacles to prayer can come not only from evil, but from what appears good. He said the enemy will sometimes attack us “from the left”—through vain, sinful, or distracting thoughts. But when that fails, he attacks “from the right”—bringing us thoughts that seem uplifting, beautiful, even spiritual—just to keep us from true prayer.

This deception, he said, is known as “right-hand theft.” It tricks the soul into preferring spiritual ideas or consoling emotions over actual communion with God. Prayer becomes replaced by thinking *about* God, rather than being *with* God.

So he warned me to gently set aside even the most inspiring thoughts if they came during prayer. Even conversations or reflections that felt spiritually nourishing could become a kind of spiritual indulgence if they distracted me from the deeper stillness of the heart. He told me: if I ever noticed I was spending more time talking *about* prayer than actually praying, or more time thinking spiritually than resting in God’s presence, I should recognize that—even this—can be a subtle form of ego, a craving for “spiritual sweets.”

Especially for beginners, he said, prayer must come first. Always. Our time spent in hidden, interior prayer must be more than any other pious activity, no matter how good it seems. For without prayer, we are like lamps without oil—shining for a moment, but unable to stay lit.

Still, not everything can or should be forgotten. Some encounters etch themselves so deeply in the heart that they remain clear in memory for years, even if we don’t dwell on them often.

I’ll tell you now about one such experience—a moment of grace that lives on in me like a warm light.

While I was traveling through the Tobolsk province, I came upon a town where my last piece of dried bread was nearly gone. I stopped at a house and humbly asked if they could spare a little food.

The man who answered smiled and said, “Thank God you came at just the right time! My wife has just taken fresh bread out of the oven. Here—take this warm loaf. And please, pray for us.”

I gratefully thanked him, and as I was putting the bread into my worn knapsack, his wife caught sight of me and said, “Look at that poor bag—it’s falling apart! Let me give you another.” She brought out a sturdy one and gave it to me with such kindness. Their generosity filled me with quiet joy. I thanked them both from the bottom of my heart and continued on my way.

Just outside the town, I stopped at a little shop and asked for some salt. The shopkeeper gave me a small bag for free. With bread and salt in hand, I rejoiced in spirit, whispering thanks to God for such unexpected blessings. I would not need to worry about food for a whole week! I could sleep in peace, with no hunger troubling my prayer.

*Bless the Lord, O my soul!* I said over and over.

A few miles down the road, I reached a poor village. There, standing humbly by the path, was a wooden church. Though small, its walls were painted with simple but beautiful frescoes. As I passed, a quiet tug in my heart drew me inside to pray.

I stepped onto the porch and stood for a moment in silence, offering my thanks to God. Two children—perhaps five or six years old—were playing nearby in the grass. They were beautifully dressed, so I assumed they must be the priest’s children.

I finished praying and turned to go. But just as I walked away, I heard voices behind me:

“*Dear beggarman! Dear beggarman, wait!*”

I turned around and saw the children—one boy, one girl—running toward me, bright-eyed and full of joy. Each took one of my hands and said, “Come with us to Mommy—she loves the poor!”

I gently replied, “But I’m not a beggar—I’m just a pilgrim, a man passing through.”

Still, they insisted, pulling me along with innocent determination.

“Then why do you carry a knapsack?” they asked with curiosity.

“I keep bread in there for the road,” I told them, smiling. “But tell me, where is your mother?”

“She’s just behind the church,” they said, tugging at my hands, “in the big house behind that little grove of trees.”

They led me through a lovely garden to a grand manor set in the middle, and we stepped inside. Everything was clean, quiet, and filled with a peaceful order. Their mother—the mistress of the house—came rushing to meet us with open arms.

“Welcome! Welcome! From where has God sent you to us?” she exclaimed warmly. “Come in, dear sir, come in and sit!”

She gently lifted the knapsack from my shoulders, placed it on the table, and led me to sit in a soft, comfortable chair.

“Would you like something to eat? A cup of tea? Is there anything you need at all?”

I looked at her with heartfelt gratitude and replied, “I thank you most humbly. I have bread enough in my sack, and while I do drink tea, we peasants aren’t really used to it. Your generous welcome and the kindness in your heart are far more precious to me than anything I could be served. I will ask God to bless you, for you live with the spirit of Scripture—the love of pilgrims and strangers.”

As I spoke those words, I felt the fire of prayer begin to burn brightly in my heart again. The inward flame rekindled, rising like a holy tide. I longed to be alone, to give full attention to the sweetness of prayer that was blossoming within me.

So I stood up gently and said, “Please forgive me, Matushka—it is time for me to take my leave. May the Lord Jesus Christ be with you and with your dear children.”

And with that, I made my way quietly out, eager to return to the solitude where I could be alone with my Beloved, in the silence of unceasing prayer.

“Oh no! God forbid that you should leave—I simply won’t allow it,” the mistress said, her voice full of warmth. “My husband is coming home from the city this evening—he’s a judge—and he will be overjoyed to meet you. He considers every pilgrim to be a messenger from God. If you go now, he’ll be so disappointed not to have met you.”

“Besides,” she continued, “tomorrow is Sunday. You can pray with us at the Divine Liturgy, and afterward we’ll share whatever meal the Lord has provided. On every feast day, we open our home to guests—sometimes as many as thirty of Christ’s poor. But you haven’t even told me anything about yourself—where you’ve come from, where you’re going! Stay and talk with me. I love to hear devout people speak of spiritual things. Children, children! Take the pilgrim’s knapsack and place it in the chapel—he will sleep there tonight.”

I was astonished by her kindness and hospitality. I thought to myself: *Am I speaking with a human being or an angel?*

So I stayed.

That evening, I met her husband, the master of the house. I told him a little about my journey and my plans to travel on to Irkutsk.

“In that case,” said the mistress, “you’ll pass through Tobolsk. My mother is there—she is now a schima nun and lives at the women’s monastery. We’ll write a letter of introduction for you, and she will gladly receive you. Many seek her out for spiritual counsel. Oh! And you can bring her the book she asked us to order from Moscow—*The Ladder of Divine Ascent* by Saint John Climacus. How beautifully all of this is coming together!”

When it was time for dinner, I joined them at the table, along with four other women. After the first course, one of the ladies stood up, made a deep bow before the icons and then to those of us at the table. She brought in the second course and sat again. Another woman rose and did the same before serving the third course.

Watching all this with quiet wonder, I leaned toward the mistress and asked, “If I may, little mother—are these women your relatives?”

She smiled. “No, but they are sisters to me in Christ. This one is our cook, the second is the coachman’s wife, the third is the housekeeper, and the fourth is my maid. They’re all married—there isn’t a single unmarried girl in my house.”

Having observed and listened to everything, I was even more astonished. I thanked God for bringing me to such devout people and felt the intense activity of prayer burning in my heart. Eager to be alone so as not to disturb this sacred prayer, I rose from the table and said to the mistress, “No doubt you will want to rest after dinner. I am accustomed to taking a walk, so I will stroll around the garden.”

“No,” she replied gently, “I do not need to rest. I will walk with you in the garden, and you can tell me something edifying. If you go alone, the children will pester you—once they see you, they won’t leave your side, for they truly love the needy brethren of Christ and pilgrims.”

With no way to refuse, I went with her. Seeking to avoid speaking about myself, I bowed before her and said, “Matushka, in the name of God, please tell me how long you have lived such a devout life and how you have achieved such piety.”

She smiled and began, “Perhaps I should tell you the whole story of my life. You see, my mother is the great-granddaughter of Saint Joasaph, whose relics rest in Belogorod and are open for veneration. We once owned a large townhouse and rented one wing to a nobleman who was not well off. When he died, his widow was pregnant, but she passed away shortly after giving birth. My mother took pity on the poor orphaned child and raised him alongside me. I was born one year later. We grew up together, studied under the same tutors, and became as close as brother and sister.”

She continued, “Some years later, my father died, and my mother moved from the city to this country estate. When we reached adulthood, my mother gave me in marriage to this orphaned young man who had grown up in our house. She settled her entire estate on us and then entered a monastery, where she had a cell built for herself. In her blessing, she exhorted us to live as true Christians: to pray earnestly to God, to love our neighbors, to care for Christ’s needy brethren with simplicity and humility, to raise our children in the fear of God, and to treat our servants as brothers.”

She paused and then added, “We have lived here by ourselves for the last ten years, striving to follow her instructions. We maintain a guesthouse for the poor, and at this moment, more than ten crippled and needy people reside with us. Perhaps tomorrow you will visit them with me.”

When she had finished her story, I asked, “Where is that book by Saint John of the Ladder that you wanted delivered to your mother?”

“Let’s go inside, and I will find it for you.”

No sooner had we settled down to read than the master of the house arrived. Upon seeing me, he embraced me warmly, and we exchanged the Christian kiss of peace. Then he led me into his own room and said, “Come, dear brother, to my study and bless my cell. I think you have had enough of her”—he gestured toward his wife—“for as soon as she sees a pilgrim or someone who is ill, she gladly spends day and night with them. This has been the way of her entire family for generations.”

We entered his study. It was filled with many books and magnificent icons, alongside a life-giving crucifix bearing a life-sized figure of Christ, with a Bible resting nearby. I prayed quietly, then said to him, “Sir, what you have here is God’s paradise. Here stands the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, His Most Pure Mother, and His holy saints; and these”—I pointed to the books—“are their divinely inspired, living words and teachings, which can never be silenced. I expect you enjoy frequent spiritual converse with them.”

“Yes, I admit it,” the master replied. “I do love to read.”

“What sort of books do you have here?” I asked.

“I have many spiritual books,” he replied. “Here is the *Chet’-Minei* for the entire year, the works of Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Basil the Great. There are numerous theological and philosophical treatises, as well as collections of sermons by the most celebrated preachers of recent times. My library is valued at five thousand rubles.”

“By any chance, do you have a book about prayer?” I asked.

“I love to read about prayer,” he answered. Then he reached for a volume on the Lord’s Prayer—the *Our Father*—written recently by a priest in Saint Petersburg. We began reading it together with great pleasure.

Shortly after, the mistress of the house brought us tea, and the children carried in a large silver basket filled with biscuits or pastries I had never before tasted. The husband took the book from me, handed it to his wife, and said, “Since she reads so beautifully, we shall have her read to us while we enjoy some refreshment.”

She began reading aloud, and as I listened, I was able to attend simultaneously to the prayer in my heart. The more she read, the stronger my inner prayer grew, filling me with deep delight. Suddenly, it seemed as though someone passed swiftly before my eyes—through the air—as if it were my late *starets*. I shuddered but, not wanting to reveal this, I quickly said, “Forgive me, I must have dozed off.”

At that moment, I felt as if the *starets*’ spirit had penetrated my own, illuminating it. A sudden enlightenment came upon my understanding, and a multitude of thoughts about prayer filled my mind. I made the sign of the cross over myself to banish these thoughts just as the mistress finished reading. Her husband then asked if I had enjoyed it, and we began to discuss the book.

“I liked it very much,” I said. “The Lord’s Prayer—the *Our Father*—is more exalted and precious than all the prayers recorded by Christians, for it was given to us by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. The commentary was very good, though it focused mainly on Christian works. In my reading of the holy Fathers, I have also encountered contemplative and mystical commentaries on this prayer.”

“In which of the Fathers did you find these teachings?” they asked.

“Well, for example, in Saint Maximus the Confessor, and also in the *Philokalia* through the writings of Saint Peter of Damascus,” I replied.

“Do you remember any of what you read? Please, tell us about it!”

“Certainly! Let us consider the very first words of the prayer: *Our Father, Who art in heaven.* The book we read today offered one interpretation, saying these words call us to brotherly love — to see all people as children of one Father. That is true, but the holy Fathers go even deeper. They teach that this phrase is an invitation to lift our minds to heaven, to the heavenly Father Himself, and to remember our sacred duty to live each moment in His presence.

“The words *hallowed be Thy Name* are explained in your book as a call to reverence — that the Name of God should never be spoken disrespectfully or taken in false oaths. Simply put, the holy Name must be spoken with awe and never in vain. Yet the mystical commentators see these words as a direct request for the gift of the interior prayer of the heart — a plea that the most holy Name of God be engraved upon the heart, hallowed by the self-active prayer, sanctifying all our feelings and spiritual powers.

“When we pray *Thy Kingdom come*, the mystical teachers interpret this as a yearning that inner peace, tranquility, and spiritual joy may descend into our hearts.

“Your book explains the petition *Give us this day our daily bread* as a request for the material necessities — not in excess, but enough to satisfy our needs and to help those in want. But Saint Maximus the Confessor offers a deeper meaning: he sees daily bread as the nourishment of the soul with the heavenly bread — the Word of God — and the union of the soul with God through constant remembrance of Him and the ceaseless interior prayer of the heart.”

“Ah! That is a great thing to aspire to,” exclaimed the master of the house, “but it seems nearly impossible for those of us living in the world to attain this interior prayer! Most of the time, we’re just grateful if the Lord helps us to say our prayers at all, without falling into laziness.”

“Do not see it as something unattainable, Batyushka,” I replied gently. “If it truly were overwhelmingly difficult, God would not have commanded all of us to pursue it. His strength is made perfect in our weakness. The holy Fathers, from their own experience, provide us with ways and methods that make it easier to enter into the prayer of the heart. Of course, hermits have special, more advanced practices, but there are also accessible methods designed for laypeople that faithfully guide us to this prayer.”

“I have never encountered anything so detailed in my readings,” the master said thoughtfully.

“If you like,” I offered, “I can read to you from the *Philokalia*.”

I retrieved my *Philokalia*, found the article by Saint Peter of Damascus in section three, and read aloud:

“‘More important than attending to your breathing, one must learn to call upon the Name of God at all times, in all places, and during all activities. The Apostle teaches us to pray without ceasing — to remember God constantly, no matter where you are or what you are doing. If you are busy with some task, remember the Creator of all. When you see the light, recall the One who gives it. When you look at the sky, the earth, the waters, and all their contents, marvel and glorify the Creator. As you put on your clothes, remember Him who gifts them to you, and thank Him for all your provisions. In short, let every action be an opportunity to remember and praise God. And before you realize it, you will be praying without ceasing, and your soul will rejoice continually.’”

“Do you see now how this method to attain unceasing prayer is convenient, simple, and within reach of anyone with a heart open to God?”

They were deeply moved by what they heard. The master embraced me joyfully and thanked me with real warmth. Then, flipping through my *Philokalia*, he said, “I’ll order this from Petersburg as soon as I can. But for now, I’ll copy that passage so I don’t forget it. Please, read it to me again.”

He listened closely as I read it once more, then quickly and neatly wrote it down. Suddenly he exclaimed, “My God! I even have an icon of the holy Damascene!” (It was likely Saint John of Damascus.) He picked up a picture frame, slipped the handwritten passage behind the glass, and hung it beneath the icon.

“There,” he said with a smile, “the living words of one of God’s saints, hanging right under his image. Now I’ll be reminded every day to put his life-giving counsel into practice.”

Later we sat down for dinner, joined by the same gathering of men and women. The table was filled with a deep and peaceful silence—a reverence that wrapped around us like a gentle cloak. After the meal, everyone, young and old, gathered for prayer. They asked me to chant the *Akathist to the Most Sweet Jesus*, and we prayed together for a long time.

Once the prayers were finished, the servants retired for the night. The three of us remained in the room a little longer. The mistress brought me a clean white shirt and a pair of socks. I bowed low and said, “Matushka, I’ll gratefully accept the shirt, but I’ve never worn socks in my life. We peasants are used to *onoochi*.”

Without hesitation, she left the room and returned with an old robe made of thin yellow fabric. She tore it in two and fashioned a pair of *onoochi* from it. Her husband, looking at my worn-out footwear, said kindly, “Look at this poor man's shoes—barely holding together.” He brought out a pair of his own *bashmaki*, new and large enough to wear over boots.

“Go change in the next room,” he said. I did as he asked, and when I came back, they sat me down and began dressing my feet themselves. The master wrapped the *onoochi* gently around my feet, while his wife helped him pull on the *bashmaki*.

At first, I protested, feeling shy and unworthy. But they quieted me, saying, “Sit still and be at peace—Christ washed the feet of His disciples.”

I could do nothing but weep. And they wept with me.

Later, the mistress retired with the children, and the master and I made our way to the little summerhouse in the garden.

We weren’t tired yet, so we lay there in the quiet summerhouse, talking late into the night. Eventually, the master turned to me with a serious look and said, “Now be honest—with God as your witness and with a clear conscience. Who are you, really? You must come from a good family and have chosen to live as a fool for Christ. The way you read and write, the way you speak so thoughtfully and clearly—it’s not the kind of learning that comes from a peasant’s life.”

I looked at him and said, “Truly, I told you and your wife everything from my heart. I had no reason to lie, and I wouldn’t. Everything I’ve shared isn’t mine, not really. It’s what I was taught by my blessed starets, who was full of wisdom from God, and what I’ve read slowly and carefully in the writings of the holy Fathers. I’m just passing it on.

“But more than anything, it’s interior prayer that’s opened my eyes—though I can’t take credit for that either. It was the Lord’s mercy, through my starets’ gentle guidance, that awakened it in me. And this, I believe, is something anyone can receive. You simply need to become quiet inside, descend into your heart, and start calling on the name of Jesus with faith and humility. Before long, a light begins to shine from within, and your understanding opens like a flower in the sun. You start to see things more clearly—even the hidden things of the Kingdom of God begin to make sense in your soul.

“To be able to enter your own heart, to see your true self, to feel that discovery with joy—and at the same time be moved to tears over how far you’ve wandered from your original goodness—that alone is a profound mystery. And once you touch that place inside, you find you can speak wisely with others too. Because wisdom doesn’t come first from schooling—it comes from the mind and heart God gave us from the beginning.

“Learning can shape the mind, yes, but only if there’s a heart that’s awake and ready. Where there’s no understanding, no awakening, no amount of books or discipline can help. The truth is, we’ve grown distant from ourselves. We rarely want to face who we truly are. Instead, we run from it, filling our days with empty distractions. We tell ourselves we’d love to live a more spiritual life, we’d love to pray more—but there’s just never enough time. We’re too busy worrying about this and that.

“But really, what could be more important than the eternal soul? This short life of ours, which we spend fussing over constantly, will pass away. The soul lasts forever. And that’s what I meant when I spoke of the difference between good judgment and foolishness.”

“Forgive me, dear brother,” he said gently, “I didn’t mean to question you out of mere curiosity. It came from a heartfelt sense of Christian concern—and also because of something that happened two years ago, which your words reminded me of.

“A beggar came to our home. He had a military discharge passport, was old and frail, and so poor that his clothes barely covered him and he had almost nothing on his feet. He didn’t talk much and spoke so simply that we assumed he was just a peasant from the steppes.

“We let him stay in our little guesthouse for the poor. But after about five days, he became very ill. So my wife and I moved him into this summerhouse and began to care for him ourselves. When it became clear he was near death, we called for our priest. He came and heard his confession, gave him Communion, and administered Holy Unction.

“Then, the day before the man died, something unexpected happened. He got up from his bed, asked for paper and a pen, and requested that we lock the door and let no one in while he wrote his final will and testament to his son. He gave us an address in Saint Petersburg and asked that we send it there after his death.

“I was amazed—not only was his handwriting graceful and refined, but his writing style was elegant, thoughtful, and perfectly composed. Tomorrow I’ll read it to you—I kept a copy.

“All of this made me deeply curious. So I gently asked him about his past. He made me promise not to reveal anything while he was alive. And then, to the glory of God, he told me the story of his life.”

He continued:

“I was once a very wealthy prince, living in splendor and indulgence, completely absorbed in a life of luxury and excess. After my wife died, I lived alone with my only son, who was doing well—he had earned the rank of captain in the Guards.

“One evening, as we were getting ready to attend a grand ball at the home of an influential noble, I lost my temper with my valet. In a sudden outburst of anger, I struck him violently on the head and ordered that he be sent back to his village.

“The next day, the valet died—his brain inflamed from the blow. But at the time, I felt only a momentary regret. I quickly forgot about it, brushing the whole matter aside.

“But about six weeks later, something began to happen. The valet started to appear to me—at first in my dreams. Night after night, he would come, staring at me and repeating, *‘Wretched man! You are my murderer!’*

“Soon, it wasn’t only in dreams. I began to see him when I was fully awake. The more time passed, the more frequently he appeared, until it seemed he was haunting me without pause.

“But he wasn’t alone for long. I began to see others too—men I had wronged, women I had seduced and abandoned. They surrounded me, accusing me, tormenting me, day and night. There was no escape.

“I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t live. I withered away to nothing. No doctor could help, no remedy eased my suffering.

“In desperation, I went abroad, hoping that new treatments might save me. But after six months, nothing had changed. In fact, the visions grew worse, more relentless. I returned home half-alive, a shell of a man.

“It was then that I knew—without any doubt—that hell exists. Not just as some idea or future judgment, but as a real, living torment. My soul had tasted its fires, while still in this body.”

"In the middle of his anguish, the man came face-to-face with the weight of his own choices. He confessed his wrongs, repented deeply, and released all his servants. Then he made a vow—not out of punishment, but out of a sincere desire to walk humbly: that for the rest of his life, he would take on hardship and live in poverty, offering himself in service to those the world tends to overlook.

And something miraculous happened.

The torment lifted. All the dark, haunting visions disappeared. In their place came a peace so deep, so radiant, that he couldn’t put it fully into words. He described it as tasting paradise itself—like the Kingdom of God had quietly opened its gates inside his own heart.

His body healed, and his soul was made light.

Without any fanfare or farewell, he set out to fulfill the promise he had made. He left his homeland, traveling alone across the vast expanse of Siberia. For fifteen years, he wandered. Sometimes he worked for humble folk, doing whatever small jobs he could. Other times he simply begged for food, asking in the name of Christ.

And yet, through all of it—all the lack, the cold, the uncertainty—he was *happy*. Deeply, sincerely happy. He said that only someone who’s been dragged through their own personal hell and then lifted into God’s mercy could understand the peace he carried.

Before he died, he handed me a letter—a will, really—and asked me to send it to his son. I still keep a copy tucked into my Bible. Would you like to read it? I have it here.

---

*In the name of God, glorified in the Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.*

*My dearest son,*

*It’s been fifteen years since you last saw me. Though I’ve had no word from you, I’ve heard little whispers about your life, and through it all, I’ve held you in the quiet place of a father’s love. That love compels me now to send these final words from my deathbed, in hopes that something in them might serve you well.*

*You know something of the pain I endured from living thoughtlessly. But you don’t yet know the joy I found in repentance. My years of wandering—though poor and unknown—were filled with a kind of bliss I never expected. There’s sweetness in a soul made clean.*

*I’m dying peacefully now, in the home of someone who showed kindness not just to me, but to you as well. When you’re able, express your thanks to him in whatever way feels true.*

*I leave you my blessing, and with it, this charge: Always remember God. Keep your conscience clear. Be wise. Be gentle. Be fair. Be kind to those who serve under you, and never look down on the poor or the homeless. Remember that your father, broken and tormented, found his healing only by walking the path of poverty and pilgrimage.*

*I now close my eyes in peace, trusting in the mercy of our Intercessor, Jesus Christ, and in the hope of eternal life.*

*Your father*

---

The kind man and I lay together in the garden summerhouse, chatting in the gentle quiet of the afternoon. After a time, I asked him something that had been on my mind.

“Tell me, Batyushka,” I said, “doesn’t running a guesthouse for pilgrims bring its share of trouble? I mean, I’ve met my fair share of wanderers who are just drifting, with no real aim—or worse, too lazy to work. Some even stir up trouble along the way. I’ve seen it myself.”

He gave a little nod, but his eyes stayed soft. “We don’t get too many like that,” he said. “Most who come here are genuine. Still, when the difficult ones do arrive, we actually make a point to welcome them even more warmly—and encourage them to stay longer.”

I looked at him, curious.

“Often,” he continued, “when they spend time living among the poor in spirit—among Christ’s own beggars—they begin to change. The rough edges soften. They leave our care different than when they arrived—quieter, humbler. More human, you could say.”

He told me about one man in particular. He’d been from a local middle-class family, but had fallen into such disgrace that even the kindest townspeople chased him away with sticks. No one would feed him, not even a crust of bread. He was known for being violent, drunk, and prone to stealing.

One day, utterly worn down and hungry, the man came to their doorstep and asked for some bread—and wine, of course, as that was his craving above all.

“We received him with kindness,” the master said. “We told him, ‘You’re welcome to stay. You’ll get all the wine you want—but only if you promise that when you’ve had your fill, you’ll quietly go to sleep. If you stir up any trouble, that’s it—we’ll not only send you away for good, but I’ll personally report you to the magistrate and have you taken to a penal colony.’”

The man agreed. And true to his word, he drank—freely and deeply—for over a week. But each time he got drunk, he simply stumbled off to bed or lay down quietly in the garden. He kept his end of the deal, mostly because he couldn’t bear the thought of losing access to the wine.

And then something started to shift.

His fellow beggars, many of whom had walked through their own valleys, gently encouraged him to try drinking less. They didn’t scold—they just invited him, bit by bit, to imagine something better. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, he began to drink less. And then one day—three months later—he stopped altogether.

He found work. He stopped begging.

And just two days before our conversation, he had come by to say thank you.

As I listened to his story, I was filled with wonder. *What wisdom,* I thought, *has been shaped here—not by control or harshness, but by love.* I couldn’t help but say aloud, “Blessed be God, who has revealed His mercy in this home you care for!”

After our talk, the master and I dozed off for a little while—maybe an hour, maybe more—until the soft ringing of the bell called us to matins. We rose quietly and made our way to the church.

When we stepped inside, I noticed his wife was already there with the children, settled in silence. We stayed for matins and then the Divine Liturgy that followed. The master and I stood with the little boy inside the altar area, while his wife and daughter knelt near the altar window, hoping to catch a glimpse of the holy mystery as the Gifts were elevated.

And then—oh, my God—how they prayed.

With heads bowed and hearts wide open, they wept. Not with sorrow, but with joy—tears pouring down their faces as if heaven itself had touched them. Their faces glowed with such pure light that I couldn’t help myself… my own eyes filled with tears too, overflowing just from witnessing the beauty of it.

There’s something about that kind of prayer—quiet, honest, full of longing and love—that opens a door inside you. Even as an onlooker, you’re pulled into its grace.

After the Liturgy, everyone made their way to the dining room—the master and mistress, the priest, the servants, and all the beggars who had come for shelter. There must have been forty of them: some crippled, others frail, children nestled among them. Yet they all sat together, shoulder to shoulder, at one long table.

What struck me most wasn’t the number of people or the food, but the *stillness*. A deep, almost sacred quiet filled the room, as if peace itself had joined us at the table.

Feeling a little bold, I leaned over to the master and said softly, “In monasteries, they often read from the lives of the saints during meals. You have the full collection—you might consider doing the same.”

He turned to his wife with a smile and said, “Masha, why don’t we start that? It would be good for everyone. I’ll read first—at this meal—and then you can read next. Then our friend Batyushka here can take a turn. After that, anyone else who can read is welcome to join in.”

The priest, who was quietly eating nearby, looked up and said, “Oh, I do love to listen. But reading? Well, forgive me, but I simply don’t have the time for it. The moment I get home there’s always something that needs doing. Children calling, cows to tend to, endless small things that pile up. I’ve got so many daily duties that I hardly remember the theology I studied in seminary.”

At that, a strange feeling passed through me—something between surprise and sorrow. But before I could say anything, the mistress gently took my hand and whispered, “He speaks this way out of humility. Always has. He may downplay himself, but he is righteous. Kind beyond words. He’s been a widower for twenty years and has raised a whole household of grandchildren—while still serving in the church, offering the sacraments faithfully and often.”

Her words brought to mind something I had once read in the *Philokalia*, from Nikitas Stethatos. He wrote, “The nature of things is measured by the interior disposition of the soul”—that is, how we see others depends on the state of our own heart. He goes on to say, *“He who has attained to genuine prayer and love no longer puts things into categories. He does not separate the righteous from the sinners, but loves all equally and does not judge them—just as God causes the sun to shine and the rain to fall on both the just and the unjust.”*

Those words settled in me again as I looked around the table. No distinctions. No judgments. Just people, gathered in the quiet love of God.

A quiet hush settled over the room again. Across from me sat a completely blind beggar, one of the guests staying at the house. The master, with his usual gentle care, fed him—cutting pieces of fish, guiding the spoon to his mouth, making sure he was nourished.

I found myself watching this man closely. His mouth stayed slightly open, and his tongue moved constantly, fluttering as though it trembled. Something about it caught my attention. I wondered if he might be one of those hidden souls—someone deep in prayer without drawing any notice. The thought stayed with me, and I kept quietly observing him.

But the peace of that moment was interrupted. One of the older women at the table suddenly became ill and began to moan in pain. Without hesitation, the master and his wife carried her into their bedroom and laid her down gently on the bed. The wife stayed at her side, and the priest went off to retrieve the Presanctified Gifts—just in case. The master called for his carriage to fetch a doctor. The rest of us quietly slipped away.

As I walked out, I felt something stirring deep within—a wave of longing. It had been two full days since I’d been alone in silence, and the desire for stillness came over me like a tide ready to break. There was a fullness inside me, like a prayer swelling within my chest that had nowhere to go. I felt it pressing against my heart—almost painfully, though not in a way I wished to stop. It was a sweet kind of ache that could only be soothed by solitude… and by prayer.

In that moment, something became clear to me. I understood, even if just faintly, why those who are drawn deeply into the life of prayer often withdraw from the noise of daily life. Why they leave behind company, even good company, to hide away in the shelter of silence. There’s something in the heart that begins to beat differently when it tastes that stillness.

It reminded me of the words of Hesychios, who taught that even the most noble conversation can become idle chatter when we’ve had too much of it. And of Saint Ephraim the Syrian, who once said, *“Good speech is silver, but silence is pure gold.”*

And that day, I knew exactly what he meant.

As I reflected on everything, I made my way back to the guesthouse where everyone was resting after the meal. I climbed quietly into the attic, finding a calm space to settle, rest, and pray for a little while.

Later, when the beggars had risen from their rest, I sought out the blind man. We walked together just beyond the kitchen garden, found a quiet spot, and sat down to talk.

I asked him gently, “For God’s sake, would you tell me—do you pray the Jesus Prayer for your own spiritual benefit?”

He nodded. “I have been praying it unceasingly for a long time now.”

“What do you experience when you pray like this?”

He smiled softly. “Only that I cannot be without the prayer, day or night.”

Curious, I pressed further. “How did God reveal this practice to you? Tell me everything, dear brother.”

He began his story. “You see, I once belonged to a local guild and made my living as a tailor. I traveled from province to province, sewing clothes for peasants.

“One time, I stayed longer than usual in a village, living with a peasant family I was making clothes for. On one of the feast days, I noticed three books lying near their icon case. I asked, ‘Who in your household knows how to read?’ They told me, ‘No one. These books were left to us by our uncle, who could read and write.’

“I picked up one book and opened it randomly. There, on one page, I found these words—words I remember clearly to this day: ‘Unceasing prayer is calling always upon the Name of God, whether one is conversing or sitting down, walking, working, or eating, or occupied with any other activity—in all places and at all times one should call upon the Name of God.’

“After reading this, I thought to myself, ‘This might actually be something I can do.’ So I began quietly repeating the prayer in a soft whisper while I sewed—and I found it very comforting.

“The others living with me in the hut began to notice and mocked me. ‘What are you?’ they said. ‘Some kind of wizard? What are you whispering all the time? Are you weaving a spell?’ To keep my prayer private, I stopped moving my lips and began to pray only with my tongue.

“In time, it became so natural that day and night my tongue would form the words on its own. And this—this became a great comfort to me.”

“So I lived like that for quite some time,” the blind man continued, “traveling from village to village with my sewing. Then, all of a sudden, I lost my sight completely. It runs in my family—most of us suffer from what they call ‘dark water.’”

He paused for a moment, and then added, “When I became too poor to care for myself, the guild arranged to have me placed in an almshouse in Tobolsk, the capital of our province. I was on my way there when the master and mistress here asked me to stop and rest with them. They said they’d help me get a cart to carry me the rest of the way.”

Something tugged at me. “That book you read from all those years ago—do you remember the title? Was it the *Philokalia*, by any chance?”

He looked thoughtful. “Honestly, I don’t know. I didn’t even look at the cover.”

I happened to have my *Philokalia* with me, and turning to Part Four, I found the passage he had quoted so clearly from memory. I read it aloud, and as soon as the words left my lips, he lit up.

“That’s it!” he cried. “That’s exactly what I read! Keep reading, brother—this is just wonderful!”

When I reached the line that said *“One should pray with the heart,”* he stopped me, eager with questions. “What does that mean? How do you do it?”

I explained that the *Philokalia* offers detailed teachings on the prayer of the heart—how to cultivate it, how to sustain it, how to descend into the inner stillness where the prayer lives and breathes. He listened with the hunger of someone who had just found a long-lost key.

He clasped my arm and said, “Would you please read the whole book to me? Every word about the prayer of the heart—I want to understand it all.”

“I’ll tell you what,” I said. “When are you planning to leave for Tobolsk?”

“I could leave right now,” he answered without hesitation.

“Then let’s travel together,” I offered. “I’m thinking of setting out tomorrow myself. Along the way, I’ll read to you all the teachings on the prayer of the heart. I’ll show you how to find that quiet place within—and how to enter it.”

“But what about the cart?” the blind man asked.

I smiled and said, “Ah, who needs a cart? We know how far Tobolsk is—it’s only a hundred miles or so. We’ll take it slow. Just think how beautiful it will be for the two of us to walk together, just the two of us. We’ll have plenty of time to talk, to read, and to soak in the teachings on prayer along the way.”

And so we agreed.

That evening, the master of the house came to invite us to supper. After the meal, we shared our plan with him—that the blind man and I would travel together on foot, and that we wouldn’t be needing the cart. We explained it would be easier this way to read from the *Philokalia* as we went. When he heard this, the master’s face lit up.

“I’ve enjoyed the *Philokalia* myself,” he said. “In fact, I’ve already written a letter enclosing some money, and I’ll be mailing it to Saint Petersburg tomorrow on my way to the courthouse. I’ve asked them to send me a copy with the next post.”

The next morning, we set out. We thanked our hosts warmly for their kindness, which had been nothing short of Christlike. Their hospitality had been full of grace. They even walked with us for a good half-mile down the road before we said our goodbyes.

The blind man and I traveled slowly, walking six to ten miles a day. The rest of our time was spent resting in quiet, hidden places—little pockets of stillness where we could read. I read to him everything in the *Philokalia* about the prayer of the heart, just as my late *starets* had taught me. We started with the writings of Nicephorus the Solitary, moved through Saint Gregory of Sinai, and continued from there.

He soaked it all in—hungrily, joyfully, like a man drinking deeply after years in the desert. His heart was wide open. And soon, he began to ask questions—so many questions! Some of them were so deep, I didn’t know how to answer.

When we’d finished all the relevant teachings, he turned to me with real urgency.

“Please,” he said, “show me. Show me how the mind finds the heart. Show me how to bring the name of Jesus Christ into it. Teach me how to feel the sweetness of that inner prayer, the one you spoke of—the one that lives and breathes in the heart.”

I said to him gently, “You may be blind in your eyes, but can you not still see things in your mind? Can you not call to mind the face of someone you once knew, or an object you once held, or even one of your own hands or feet? Can you not picture it as clearly in your mind as if you were looking straight at it? And can you not, even now, focus your inner gaze upon it—just as you once focused your outer eyes?”

“But what about the cart?” he asked.

“Eh, who needs a cart? We know how far Tobolsk is—it’s only about a hundred miles. We’ll just walk slowly. Think how good it will be for us to travel together, just the two of us. That way, we can talk and read about prayer as we walk.” So we agreed.

That evening, the master himself came and invited us to dinner. After the meal, we told him that the blind man and I had decided to travel together on foot and wouldn’t need the cart. It would be easier for us to read the *Philokalia* that way. When he heard this, the master said, “I, too, enjoyed the *Philokalia*. In fact, I’ve already written a letter and enclosed some money, which I’ll send to Saint Petersburg tomorrow on my way to the courthouse. I’ve asked them to send me a copy with the next post.”

The next day we set out, warmly thanking our hosts for their extraordinary love and hospitality. They walked with us for over half a mile before we parted ways.

The blind man and I took short walks each day, about six to ten miles at a time. The rest of the time, we sat in quiet places and read from the *Philokalia*. I read to him everything about the prayer of the heart, following the order my late spiritual father had given me—starting with the writings of Nicephorus the Solitary, then Saint Gregory of Sinai, and so on. He listened with eagerness and joy, soaking it all in. Then he began asking me questions about prayer—questions so deep that I didn’t always know how to answer them.

When we had read all the essential passages, he earnestly asked me to show him how the mind finds the heart, how to bring the Name of Jesus into it, and how to experience the sweet inner prayer of the heart.

I explained it this way: “You’re blind and can’t see, but aren’t you still able to picture in your mind what you once saw with your eyes—a person, an object, or even your own hand or foot? Can’t you visualize it clearly, almost as if you were really seeing it, and even focus your eyes on it, even though you’re blind?”

“I can do that,” said the blind man.

“Well then, do the same thing with your heart. Try to picture your heart in your mind. Focus your eyes on it, as if you were looking right through your chest. Picture it as clearly as you can. Then, listen to its steady beating. Once you’ve done that, begin to say the prayer in rhythm with your heartbeat, keeping your mental focus on your heart. On the first beat, say ‘Lord’; on the second, ‘Jesus’; on the third, ‘Christ’; on the fourth, ‘have mercy’; on the fifth, ‘on me.’ Keep repeating this again and again. It should be easy for you, since you already know the basics of heart-prayer.

“When you get used to it, you can begin to say the full Jesus Prayer in rhythm with your breath. As you inhale, focus on your heart and say, ‘Lord Jesus Christ.’ As you exhale, say, ‘have mercy on me.’ Do this as often as you can. Soon, you’ll start to feel a gentle but pleasant ache in your heart, followed by warmth and tenderness. If you stay with this practice, with God’s help, you’ll experience the sweet, self-acting prayer of the heart.

“But as you do this, be careful not to let your imagination wander or to entertain any visions. Reject everything the imagination brings up, because the holy Fathers teach that true inner prayer must be without images or visions—otherwise you risk falling into delusion.”

The blind man listened intently and began practicing the method with great dedication, especially at night when we stopped to rest. After about five days, he began to feel a strong warmth and an indescribable sweetness in his heart. A longing to pray constantly grew in him, and it stirred a deep love for Jesus Christ.

From time to time, he began to see a light, though he didn’t see any shapes or objects—just the light. Sometimes, as he entered into his heart in prayer, he would feel a flame like a candle flare up sweetly inside him, rising from his heart through his throat. It seemed to light him up from within, and on one occasion, he even seemed to be able to see things at a distance.

We were walking through a forest, and he was silently absorbed in prayer. Suddenly he said, “What a pity! The church is already on fire, and the belfry has collapsed.”

“Stop imagining things,” I said. “That’s just a temptation. You need to push those thoughts away. How could you possibly know what’s happening in the city when we’re still almost eight miles away?”

He listened to me, kept praying, and said no more. But when we arrived in the city that evening, I saw burned-down buildings and a collapsed belfry that had stood on wooden piles. A crowd had gathered, astonished that no one had been hurt when it fell. From what I could tell, the fire and collapse had happened at exactly the time the blind man had said.

He turned to me and said, “You said I was imagining things, but it happened just as I described. How can one not love and give thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, who shows His grace even to sinners, to the blind and the simple! And I thank you, too, for teaching me the work of the heart.”

“You can love Jesus Christ and be as grateful to Him as you will,” I said, “but beware of accepting visions as direct revelations of grace, because such things can often occur as natural manifestations, according to the natural order of things. Man’s soul is not absolutely bound by space and matter. It can also see events through darkness and at very great distances, as if they were happening nearby. It is we who do not give power and momentum to this capability in our souls, and we squelch it beneath the bonds of either the carnal fleshiness of our bodies or our confused thoughts and scattered ideas. Yet, when we focus our attention on the inner self, divert our concentration from everything external, and refine our mind, then the soul finds its truest fulfillment and exercises its highest powers, which is quite natural. I heard from my late starets that nonpraying people or people who have a certain ability or suffer from sick disorders are able to see, in the darkest room, the aura of light that radiates from all things, to distinguish between various objects, to sense the presence of their double, and to know the thoughts of others. But what occurs during the prayer of the heart is the direct result of God’s grace, and it is so delightful that no tongue can describe it, attribute it to anything material, or compare it to anything at all. All physical sensations are base in comparison to the delightful experience of grace acting within the heart.”

My blind man listened seriously to all this and was even more humbled by it. The prayer continued to increase within his heart, delighting him beyond description. I rejoiced in this with all my heart and earnestly thanked God for granting me to have met such a blessed servant of His.

At last we arrived in Tobolsk, where I took him to the almshouse. After kindly parting with him, I left him there and continued on my own journey.

For a month I walked slowly, reflecting in depth on how edifying and encouraging the good experiences in life can be. I read the *Philokalia* frequently to verify all that I had told the blind man of prayer. The edifying example of his experience kindled in me a zeal, gratitude, and love for the Lord. The prayer of the heart delighted me so much that I thought there could be no one happier than I in the whole world and could not imagine how there could be any greater or deeper contentment in the Kingdom of Heaven. Not only did I experience all this within my soul, but everything around me appeared to be enchanting and inspired me with love for and gratitude to God. People, trees, plants, and animals—I felt kinship with them all and discovered how each bore the seal of the Name of Jesus Christ. At times I felt so lightweight, as if I had no body and were not walking but rather joyously floating through the air. At other times I entered so fully into myself that I saw clearly all my inner organs, and this caused me to marvel at the wisdom that went into creating the human body. Sometimes I knew such joy that I felt as if I had been crowned a king. It was at such moments of consolation that I wished that God would grant me to die as soon as possible, so that I could pour myself out in gratitude at His feet in the spiritual world.

Yet I began to notice something shifting in me. Even though my heart had been so full of joy, there was now a quiet unease creeping in—a kind of anxiety or hidden fear. I found myself wondering, *“Is something about to go wrong?”* The memory of that young village girl came rushing back—the one I had taught the Jesus Prayer in the chapel, only for it all to end in such pain.

I remembered how easily joy could be followed by trial.

Then I thought of the wise words of Blessed John of Karpathos: how a spiritual teacher often bears hardship, even humiliation, for the sake of others’ growth. It struck me—maybe these inner shadows weren’t something to resist, but to understand. Maybe they were part of the path too.

Still, I didn’t want to stay in that anxious place, so I turned my attention back to prayer. I prayed with all the sincerity I could gather. And something beautiful happened—just like before, the heaviness lifted. The fears dissolved. I felt steadied again, gently returned to peace.

“Let God’s will be done,” I said to myself with a full heart. “Whatever Jesus allows, I will bear it. I know I’m still proud and flawed. But even those few people I’ve shared the mystery of interior prayer with—God had already been guiding them in secret before I ever crossed their path.”

That thought settled me like a soft blanket. Once again, I was filled with consolation. The prayer returned to its gentle rhythm within me, and my joy came back—deeper now, and even more peaceful than before. I continued down the road, feeling like I was walking not just forward, but inward, toward the Light.

It had been raining steadily for two full days. The road had turned to deep, sticky mud that swallowed my legs with every step. I could barely walk. So I left the road and cut across the open steppe, where I didn’t see a single soul for nearly ten miles.

By evening, I finally spotted a small farmstead near the roadside. Relief flooded me. *“Thank God,”* I thought, *“Maybe I can rest here for the night. Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll accept it with gratitude. Maybe even the weather will clear.”*

As I approached, I saw an older man sitting on a mound of earth outside. He looked like he’d had too much to drink and wore a tattered military overcoat. Still, I bowed politely and asked, “Would it be possible to ask someone here if I might stay the night?”

The man bellowed back, “Who else would give you permission but me? I’m in charge here! This is a post station—and I’m the postmaster!”

“Well then, Batyushka,” I said gently, “May I stay here tonight?”

“Got a passport?” he snapped. “Show me some legal proof of who you are!”

I handed him my passport. But no sooner had he taken it than he asked, “So, where’s the passport?”

“You’re holding it in your hands,” I told him.

“Oh… well then—let’s go inside the hut.”

Once inside, he put on a pair of glasses, looked over my passport, and said, “Yep, seems legit. You can stay the night. I’m a good man, you know. Here—let me offer you a welcome drink!”

“I’ve never had a drink in my life,” I replied quietly.

“Who cares!” he laughed. “At least join us for dinner.”

So I sat down to eat with him and his cook, a young peasant woman who was already more than a little drunk herself.

We shared the meal, but it was hardly peaceful. The two of them argued the whole time, throwing insults back and forth like it was a game. By the time the meal ended, they were in the middle of a full-blown fight.

The postmaster stumbled off to sleep in the pantry, while the cook cleared the table, muttering curses under her breath as she washed the cups and spoons.

I sat quietly for a while, waiting for the cook to calm down. But she kept stomping around the room, muttering under her breath. Realizing it might take some time, I asked gently, “Matushka, is there anywhere I could sleep? I’m completely worn out from the road.”

“Of course, Batyushka,” she said. “I’ll make you a bed.” She dragged another bench over next to the one by the front window, laid a felt blanket across it, and placed a pillow at the head. I lay down and closed my eyes, pretending to sleep so she could go about her business without feeling watched.

She bustled about the room for quite some time, cleaning and tidying. Eventually, she put out the fire. Just as she started walking toward me, there was a sudden and terrifying crash—the entire window in the front corner of the hut burst inward, frame and glass and even splinters of the wall above it flying into the room.

The whole house trembled.

Outside the window, we heard groaning, shouting, and the sound of a struggle. The cook screamed and leapt back in fear, landing flat on the floor. I jolted upright, barely awake, thinking the ground had split open beneath me.

Then two coach drivers burst through the door, carrying a man between them who was so badly injured and covered in blood that I couldn’t even see his face. The sight of him sent a wave of horror through me.

It turned out he was a royal courier. He had come here to change horses, but his driver misjudged the entrance to the gates. The carriage pole smashed through the window, and with a ditch in front of the house, the wagon had flipped. The courier had been thrown from the carriage and struck his head on a sharp wooden stake—part of the earth mound that served as a bench near the house.

He was bleeding badly but still conscious. “Water! Wine!” he demanded. Someone brought him both, and he used them to clean the deep wound on his head. After that, he drank a glass of the wine.

Then he roared, “Get the horses!”

I approached him and said softly, “Batyushka, how can you possibly travel when you’re in such pain?”

“A royal courier has no time to be sick,” he said firmly, then climbed into the carriage and galloped off.

The coach drivers dragged the peasant woman—who had passed out from fright—over to the stove in the corner and covered her with a bast mat.

“She’s just in shock,” one of them said. “She’ll come around soon.”

The postmaster, still groggy from his hangover, took another drink to steady himself and went right back to bed, leaving me alone.

Before long, the woman began to stir. She got up and started pacing the room, slowly walking back and forth from corner to corner. Then, without saying a word, she stepped outside into the night.

I said my prayers and realized how deeply tired I was. Just before dawn, I finally managed to get a little sleep.

In the morning, I thanked the postmaster and set out on my way. As I walked, I prayed with faith, hope, and gratitude to the Father—the source of all blessing and comfort—who had protected me from what could have been a terrible disaster.

Six years later, I was passing by a women’s monastery and decided to stop in to pray. The abbess was very kind and welcoming to travelers, and after the Liturgy, she invited me in and asked one of the sisters to bring me tea.

While I waited, some unexpected guests arrived, and the abbess left to greet them. I found myself alone with the nuns.

One of them came over to pour me tea. There was something gentle and humble in her presence, and I felt moved to ask, “Matyushka, have you lived in the monastery long?”

“Five years,” she replied. “I was out of my mind when I first came here. But God was merciful, and the mother abbess allowed me to stay and take the veil.”

“What happened to you?” I asked.

“I had a terrible shock one night while working at a post station,” she said. “I was asleep when some horses crashed through the window. The fear drove me mad. For a year, my family took me from one holy site to another, hoping I’d be healed. But it was only here, in this monastery, that I found peace and was restored.”

When I heard this, my heart rejoiced. I silently gave thanks and praise to God, who, in His wisdom, arranges everything for good.

“There were also many other incidents,” I said, turning to my spiritual father. “Were I to tell them all in the order they occurred, three days and nights would not be enough. But I will tell you one more.”

One clear summer day, as I walked along the road, I saw a churchyard—a cemetery with a church and some houses for the clergy. The bell rang for the Liturgy, so I began walking toward the church. Some local people were also heading that way, while others sat in the grass nearby. When they saw me hurrying, they said, “No need to rush. You’ll have plenty of time to stand around before it starts. The services here are really long because the priest is in poor health and moves slowly.”

Indeed, the service was long. The priest was a young man, but he looked terribly thin and pale. He celebrated the service very slowly, yet with deep reverence. At the end, he gave a heartfelt and clear sermon on the many ways to grow in love for God.

Afterward, the priest invited me to his home for lunch. As we sat at the table, I said, “You serve so slowly and devoutly, Father.”

“Yes,” he replied, “even though my parishioners complain about it. But what can I do? I like to reflect on every word of the prayers and savor them. If we say words without feeling or understanding, it does no good—for ourselves or for others. It all comes down to the inner life and prayer from the heart. But very few people care about that. They don’t want to work at it. They aren’t interested in spiritual light within.”

“And how does one gain this inner light?” I asked. “It sounds like it requires great wisdom.”

“Quite a bit,” he said. “To live an inner, prayerful life and be spiritually awake, you need to take one verse from Scripture and focus all your attention on it. Meditate on it as long as you can. The light of understanding will come. The same applies to prayer. If you want it to be pure and full of joy, then choose a short prayer—just a few powerful words—and repeat it often and for a long time. You’ll start to love praying.”

His words really touched me. They were so practical and simple, yet full of wisdom. In my heart I thanked God for leading me to such a true shepherd.

After the meal, the priest said, “Why not rest a bit while I read the Bible and prepare tomorrow’s sermon?” So I went into the kitchen, where there was only one person—an extremely old woman hunched in the corner, coughing. I sat near the window, took out my Philokalia, and began reading quietly.

After a while, I noticed the old woman was whispering the Jesus Prayer—over and over, without stopping. I was filled with joy to hear the holy Name being said so faithfully, and I said to her, “How wonderful, dear mother, that you’re praying without ceasing! It’s the best thing a Christian can do.”

“Yes, Batyushka,” she replied, “at my age, my only comfort is to ask the Lord for mercy.”

“How long have you been saying this prayer so constantly?”

“Since I was a little girl, Batyushka. I can’t live without it. The Jesus Prayer saved me from disaster and death.”

I leaned closer. “Please, tell me your story. I want to glorify God and praise the power of His name.”

She began:

“I was once a young, beautiful girl. My parents arranged a marriage for me, and the day before the wedding, my fiancé came to visit. Just ten steps from the house, he collapsed and died without a word. I was so shocked and frightened that I decided never to marry. I gave myself to God instead, choosing a life of prayer and pilgrimage.

“But I was still young and afraid to travel alone. An older woman, a seasoned pilgrim, told me that if I repeated the Jesus Prayer constantly as I walked, no harm would come to me. I believed her, and truly, I was never hurt, even as I traveled to faraway shrines. My parents supported my journeys.

“As I grew older, my body weakened, and this kind priest welcomed me into his home and feeds me. I’m grateful for every breath.”

I listened with awe, my heart full of thanks to God for such a rich and holy day. I received the priest’s blessing and continued on my way, filled with joy.

Not long after, I passed through the Kazansk region and had another experience—one that showed me just how powerful the Jesus Prayer can be, even when someone isn’t fully aware of what it is they’re doing. It also showed me that frequent and constant repetition is the surest path to its fruits.

It was evening, and I came into a Tatar village. Near the edge of town, I saw a Russian coachman standing next to a wagon outside a small house. The horses were grazing nearby. I was relieved to see a fellow Christian and decided to ask for lodging, hoping I might spend the night with him.

“Who’s your passenger?” I asked.

“My master,” he said, “traveling from Kazan to the Crimea.”

While I was speaking with the coachman, his master opened the curtains of the carriage, looked out, and saw me.

“I’m spending the night here too,” he said, “but I didn’t want to stay in the hut. Tatar homes are so uncomfortable, I decided to sleep in my carriage instead.”
Since the evening was pleasant, he stepped out for a walk, and we began to talk.

As we chatted, I asked him many questions, and he told me this story about himself:

“I served in the navy as a high-ranking captain until I was sixty-five. As I got older, I developed gout—a painful condition with no cure. I retired and moved to my wife’s farm in the Crimea, but I was almost always sick.

“My wife was a restless, extravagant woman who loved gambling. She didn’t want to live with a sick man, so she left me and moved to Kazan to live with our daughter, who was married to a civil servant. Before she left, she took everything—even the servants. She left me with only one person: an eight-year-old boy who was my godson.

“For three years, I lived alone. The boy, though young, was smart and took care of all the household work. He cleaned the house, kept the stove lit, cooked porridge, and boiled water for tea. But despite how helpful he was, he was constantly causing trouble. He would run around, make noise, shout, and play endlessly, which irritated me terribly.

“Because of my illness—and probably also out of boredom—I took great interest in reading spiritual books. My favorite was a large book by Saint Gregory Palamas on the Jesus Prayer. I read it all the time, and occasionally practiced the prayer myself.

“But the boy’s mischief made it hard to focus. No amount of scolding or punishment seemed to help. So I came up with a plan. I made him sit beside me on a footstool and told him to repeat the Jesus Prayer over and over.

“At first, he didn’t like it. He tried everything to avoid it. Sometimes he would just sit there in silence.”

To help the boy take the prayer seriously, I kept a rod nearby—not that I used it much, but the sight of it was enough to keep him focused. I would quietly read while he prayed aloud, listening to his voice. Whenever he stopped, I’d just point to the rod, and that was enough to get him going again.

Oddly enough, it brought peace to my home. The noise and chaos faded, and for the first time in a while, I felt calm.

Before long, I noticed something surprising—he no longer needed any prompting at all. The rod sat untouched. He started saying the prayer on his own, more eagerly, even joyfully. I could see a real change in him. He was calmer, more thoughtful, and he began doing his chores better than ever.

That warmed my heart. I started giving him more freedom. And then, something remarkable happened.

He became so attached to the Jesus Prayer that he began saying it all the time—while working, walking, doing anything. It came out of him naturally, like breathing.

Curious, I asked him, “Why do you keep praying so much?”

He shrugged and said simply, “I don’t know. I just really want to. I can’t stop—I want to say it all the time.”

“And what do you feel when you pray?”

“Nothing in particular,” he said, “except… it feels really nice when I do.”

“Is that good?”

He smiled. “I don’t know what to say. I just know I’m happy.”

By the time the Crimean War began, the boy was twelve. I took him with me to Kazan to stay with my daughter. He had to live in the kitchen with the other servants. But he didn’t like it there. The other kids would joke around and play, constantly teasing him and interrupting his prayer.

After a few months, he came to me and said, “I’m going back home. It’s too noisy here—I can’t take it.”

“It’s winter,” I told him. “You can’t make that journey alone. Wait until I go back, and I’ll take you with me.”

“The very next day, the boy disappeared. We searched everywhere, but he was nowhere to be found. Then, a letter came—from the Crimea. It was from some people who had stayed behind on our farm. They wrote that on April 4th, the day after Easter, they found the boy dead in my empty house. He was lying peacefully on the floor of my room, his hands folded prayerfully on his chest, a cap placed gently under his head. He was wearing the same thin frock coat he always wore when he lived with me—the very one he was wearing when he left. And so they buried him in the garden.

“When I got that letter, I was completely stunned. How could he have possibly made it back to the farm so quickly? He left on February 26th and was found on April 4th. That’s nearly two thousand miles in a little over a month. Even with God’s help, you’d still need horses to cover that distance! Sixty-five miles a day? And this, with no passport, no warm clothes, not even a coin in his pocket. Maybe someone gave him a ride, sure—but even that would have needed God’s direct care to make happen.

“Well,” the master finished, “my boy tasted the fruits of prayer. And here I am, in my old age, and I’ve still not reached the depth he had found.”

I told him, “Batyushka, you used to read that wonderful book by the blessed Gregory Palamas, didn’t you? I’ve read it too, and it’s beautiful—but it focuses mostly on praying with your lips. What you should read is the *Philokalia*. That’s where you’ll find the full teaching—the way of bringing the Jesus Prayer deeper, into the mind and the heart, and experiencing its sweetest fruit.” I handed him my copy, and I could tell how pleased he was. He promised to find a copy for himself.

I thought to myself, “My God, what incredible things You do through this prayer. How full of wisdom are the ways You teach us! A rod—that simple rod—taught a young boy to pray, and even led him to deep consolation. Could it be that the sorrows and trials we face in prayer are, in fact, Your own ‘rod’? If so, why do we become so fearful and upset when these trials come to us? After all, they are sent by the hand of our loving Father in heaven—maybe they’re meant to train us, to bring us closer, and to lead us to a joy beyond words.”

When I finished telling my story, I turned to my spiritual father and said, “Please forgive me—I’ve talked far too long. The holy Fathers teach that even conversations about spiritual things can turn into vanity if we go on without restraint. It’s time for me to go and meet up with my companion to Jerusalem. Please pray for me—a poor sinner—that the Lord, in His endless mercy, will grant me a safe journey.”

“My dear brother in Christ,” he said, “with all my heart I pray that God’s grace, full of love, will bless your journey and go with you—just like the angel Raphael went with Tobias.”
