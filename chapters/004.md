> *But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord God my refuge…*
> —Psalm 73:28

When I came to visit my spiritual father, I said,
“How true it is, what the old Russian proverb says: *‘Man proposes, but God disposes.’*
I had every intention of leaving today, beginning my journey to the holy city of Jerusalem. But something entirely unexpected happened. A small event—completely unforeseen—has kept me here for three more days. And I couldn’t resist coming to see you, Father, to ask your advice about how to handle it. Let me tell you what happened.

After I had said my farewells and entrusted myself to God, I set out with a light heart. But just as I was passing through the city gates, I saw a familiar face standing in the doorway of the last house. It was a fellow pilgrim—someone I hadn’t seen in three years. We greeted each other warmly, and he asked where I was headed.

“I’m hoping to reach old Jerusalem, God willing,” I replied.

“Thank God!” he said. “I know the perfect traveling companion for you!”

“God bless you and him,” I said, “but surely you remember—I’ve never traveled with companions. I’m used to walking alone.”

“Yes, yes, I know,” he said. “But listen—this companion would suit you perfectly. You see, I work in this very house, and the father of the master has also made a vow to visit Jerusalem. He’s a good man—older, humble, a bit deaf. In fact, he’s *very* deaf. You could shout your head off and he wouldn’t hear a thing. If you need to speak to him, you’d have to write it down on paper. So you won’t be bothered by chatter—he hardly talks at home either. But he could really use your help on the road.”

He went on, “His son is giving him a horse and wagon for the journey to Odessa. From there, he’ll sell both and continue on by ship. The old man wants to walk most of the way, but he needs the wagon for his belongings and a few gifts he’s bringing to the Lord’s tomb. You could even load your own knapsack onto the wagon—just think of it! And how could you let an old, deaf man go off all by himself on such a long road? It’s dangerous. He’s carrying some money and parcels, and we’ve been trying to find someone trustworthy to accompany him. But everyone wants too much in return—and none of them are right. You would be just the person. I’ll vouch for you to his family, and they’ll be thrilled. They’re good people. They care for me, and I’ve worked for them these past two years.”

We had been talking at the doorway, but then he brought me inside and introduced me to the master of the house. Right away, I could tell this was a good, honest family—humble, generous, full of decency. So I agreed to their offer. We planned to set out, God willing, on the third day after Christmas, right after the Divine Liturgy.

Isn’t it something how these unexpected turns happen in life? And yet, in all of it, God’s hand gently steers our course. As the Scriptures say, *“For God is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure”* (Philippians 2:13).

When I finished telling this story, my spiritual father smiled and said,
“I rejoice with all my heart, dear brother, that the Lord has let me see you again—so soon, and so unexpectedly! Since you still have some time before your journey, I ask you, lovingly, to stay a little longer. Tell me more about the spiritual lessons you’ve received during your long pilgrimage. I’ve listened with such delight to your stories.”

“I would be glad to,” I replied. And so I began to share again.

So many things have happened to me—both joyful and sorrowful—that I could never recount them all. Some I’ve even forgotten. My heart was always more drawn toward whatever awakened my lazy soul to prayer. The rest, I tried to leave behind. As the apostle Paul says, *“forgetting what lies behind and striving forward to what lies ahead”* (Philippians 3:13).

Even my blessed starets, of holy memory, used to teach that the greatest obstacles to prayer can come not only from evil, but from what appears good. He said the enemy will sometimes attack us “from the left”—through vain, sinful, or distracting thoughts. But when that fails, he attacks “from the right”—bringing us thoughts that seem uplifting, beautiful, even spiritual—just to keep us from true prayer.

This deception, he said, is known as “right-hand theft.” It tricks the soul into preferring spiritual ideas or consoling emotions over actual communion with God. Prayer becomes replaced by thinking *about* God, rather than being *with* God.

So he warned me to gently set aside even the most inspiring thoughts if they came during prayer. Even conversations or reflections that felt spiritually nourishing could become a kind of spiritual indulgence if they distracted me from the deeper stillness of the heart. He told me: if I ever noticed I was spending more time talking *about* prayer than actually praying, or more time thinking spiritually than resting in God’s presence, I should recognize that—even this—can be a subtle form of ego, a craving for “spiritual sweets.”

Especially for beginners, he said, prayer must come first. Always. Our time spent in hidden, interior prayer must be more than any other pious activity, no matter how good it seems. For without prayer, we are like lamps without oil—shining for a moment, but unable to stay lit.

Still, not everything can or should be forgotten. Some encounters etch themselves so deeply in the heart that they remain clear in memory for years, even if we don’t dwell on them often.

I’ll tell you now about one such experience—a moment of grace that lives on in me like a warm light.

While I was traveling through the Tobolsk province, I came upon a town where my last piece of dried bread was nearly gone. I stopped at a house and humbly asked if they could spare a little food.

The man who answered smiled and said, “Thank God you came at just the right time! My wife has just taken fresh bread out of the oven. Here—take this warm loaf. And please, pray for us.”

I gratefully thanked him, and as I was putting the bread into my worn knapsack, his wife caught sight of me and said, “Look at that poor bag—it’s falling apart! Let me give you another.” She brought out a sturdy one and gave it to me with such kindness. Their generosity filled me with quiet joy. I thanked them both from the bottom of my heart and continued on my way.

Just outside the town, I stopped at a little shop and asked for some salt. The shopkeeper gave me a small bag for free. With bread and salt in hand, I rejoiced in spirit, whispering thanks to God for such unexpected blessings. I would not need to worry about food for a whole week! I could sleep in peace, with no hunger troubling my prayer.

*Bless the Lord, O my soul!* I said over and over.

A few miles down the road, I reached a poor village. There, standing humbly by the path, was a wooden church. Though small, its walls were painted with simple but beautiful frescoes. As I passed, a quiet tug in my heart drew me inside to pray.

I stepped onto the porch and stood for a moment in silence, offering my thanks to God. Two children—perhaps five or six years old—were playing nearby in the grass. They were beautifully dressed, so I assumed they must be the priest’s children.

I finished praying and turned to go. But just as I walked away, I heard voices behind me:

“*Dear beggarman! Dear beggarman, wait!*”

I turned around and saw the children—one boy, one girl—running toward me, bright-eyed and full of joy. Each took one of my hands and said, “Come with us to Mommy—she loves the poor!”

I gently replied, “But I’m not a beggar—I’m just a pilgrim, a man passing through.”

Still, they insisted, pulling me along with innocent determination.

“Then why do you carry a knapsack?” they asked with curiosity.

“I keep bread in there for the road,” I told them, smiling. “But tell me, where is your mother?”

“She’s just behind the church,” they said, tugging at my hands, “in the big house behind that little grove of trees.”

They led me through a lovely garden to a grand manor set in the middle, and we stepped inside. Everything was clean, quiet, and filled with a peaceful order. Their mother—the mistress of the house—came rushing to meet us with open arms.

“Welcome! Welcome! From where has God sent you to us?” she exclaimed warmly. “Come in, dear sir, come in and sit!”

She gently lifted the knapsack from my shoulders, placed it on the table, and led me to sit in a soft, comfortable chair.

“Would you like something to eat? A cup of tea? Is there anything you need at all?”

I looked at her with heartfelt gratitude and replied, “I thank you most humbly. I have bread enough in my sack, and while I do drink tea, we peasants aren’t really used to it. Your generous welcome and the kindness in your heart are far more precious to me than anything I could be served. I will ask God to bless you, for you live with the spirit of Scripture—the love of pilgrims and strangers.”

As I spoke those words, I felt the fire of prayer begin to burn brightly in my heart again. The inward flame rekindled, rising like a holy tide. I longed to be alone, to give full attention to the sweetness of prayer that was blossoming within me.

So I stood up gently and said, “Please forgive me, Matushka—it is time for me to take my leave. May the Lord Jesus Christ be with you and with your dear children.”

And with that, I made my way quietly out, eager to return to the solitude where I could be alone with my Beloved, in the silence of unceasing prayer.

“Oh no! God forbid that you should leave—I simply won’t allow it,” the mistress said, her voice full of warmth. “My husband is coming home from the city this evening—he’s a judge—and he will be overjoyed to meet you. He considers every pilgrim to be a messenger from God. If you go now, he’ll be so disappointed not to have met you.”

“Besides,” she continued, “tomorrow is Sunday. You can pray with us at the Divine Liturgy, and afterward we’ll share whatever meal the Lord has provided. On every feast day, we open our home to guests—sometimes as many as thirty of Christ’s poor. But you haven’t even told me anything about yourself—where you’ve come from, where you’re going! Stay and talk with me. I love to hear devout people speak of spiritual things. Children, children! Take the pilgrim’s knapsack and place it in the chapel—he will sleep there tonight.”

I was astonished by her kindness and hospitality. I thought to myself: *Am I speaking with a human being or an angel?*

So I stayed.

That evening, I met her husband, the master of the house. I told him a little about my journey and my plans to travel on to Irkutsk.

“In that case,” said the mistress, “you’ll pass through Tobolsk. My mother is there—she is now a schima nun and lives at the women’s monastery. We’ll write a letter of introduction for you, and she will gladly receive you. Many seek her out for spiritual counsel. Oh! And you can bring her the book she asked us to order from Moscow—*The Ladder of Divine Ascent* by Saint John Climacus. How beautifully all of this is coming together!”

When it was time for dinner, I joined them at the table, along with four other women. After the first course, one of the ladies stood up, made a deep bow before the icons and then to those of us at the table. She brought in the second course and sat again. Another woman rose and did the same before serving the third course.

Watching all this with quiet wonder, I leaned toward the mistress and asked, “If I may, little mother—are these women your relatives?”

She smiled. “No, but they are sisters to me in Christ. This one is our cook, the second is the coachman’s wife, the third is the housekeeper, and the fourth is my maid. They’re all married—there isn’t a single unmarried girl in my house.”

Having observed and listened to everything, I was even more astonished. I thanked God for bringing me to such devout people and felt the intense activity of prayer burning in my heart. Eager to be alone so as not to disturb this sacred prayer, I rose from the table and said to the mistress, “No doubt you will want to rest after dinner. I am accustomed to taking a walk, so I will stroll around the garden.”

“No,” she replied gently, “I do not need to rest. I will walk with you in the garden, and you can tell me something edifying. If you go alone, the children will pester you—once they see you, they won’t leave your side, for they truly love the needy brethren of Christ and pilgrims.”

With no way to refuse, I went with her. Seeking to avoid speaking about myself, I bowed before her and said, “Matushka, in the name of God, please tell me how long you have lived such a devout life and how you have achieved such piety.”

She smiled and began, “Perhaps I should tell you the whole story of my life. You see, my mother is the great-granddaughter of Saint Joasaph, whose relics rest in Belogorod and are open for veneration. We once owned a large townhouse and rented one wing to a nobleman who was not well off. When he died, his widow was pregnant, but she passed away shortly after giving birth. My mother took pity on the poor orphaned child and raised him alongside me. I was born one year later. We grew up together, studied under the same tutors, and became as close as brother and sister.”

She continued, “Some years later, my father died, and my mother moved from the city to this country estate. When we reached adulthood, my mother gave me in marriage to this orphaned young man who had grown up in our house. She settled her entire estate on us and then entered a monastery, where she had a cell built for herself. In her blessing, she exhorted us to live as true Christians: to pray earnestly to God, to love our neighbors, to care for Christ’s needy brethren with simplicity and humility, to raise our children in the fear of God, and to treat our servants as brothers.”

She paused and then added, “We have lived here by ourselves for the last ten years, striving to follow her instructions. We maintain a guesthouse for the poor, and at this moment, more than ten crippled and needy people reside with us. Perhaps tomorrow you will visit them with me.”

When she had finished her story, I asked, “Where is that book by Saint John of the Ladder that you wanted delivered to your mother?”

“Let’s go inside, and I will find it for you.”

No sooner had we settled down to read than the master of the house arrived. Upon seeing me, he embraced me warmly, and we exchanged the Christian kiss of peace. Then he led me into his own room and said, “Come, dear brother, to my study and bless my cell. I think you have had enough of her”—he gestured toward his wife—“for as soon as she sees a pilgrim or someone who is ill, she gladly spends day and night with them. This has been the way of her entire family for generations.”

We entered his study. It was filled with many books and magnificent icons, alongside a life-giving crucifix bearing a life-sized figure of Christ, with a Bible resting nearby. I prayed quietly, then said to him, “Sir, what you have here is God’s paradise. Here stands the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, His Most Pure Mother, and His holy saints; and these”—I pointed to the books—“are their divinely inspired, living words and teachings, which can never be silenced. I expect you enjoy frequent spiritual converse with them.”

“Yes, I admit it,” the master replied. “I do love to read.”

“What sort of books do you have here?” I asked.

“I have many spiritual books,” he replied. “Here is the *Chet’-Minei* for the entire year, the works of Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Basil the Great. There are numerous theological and philosophical treatises, as well as collections of sermons by the most celebrated preachers of recent times. My library is valued at five thousand rubles.”

“By any chance, do you have a book about prayer?” I asked.

“I love to read about prayer,” he answered. Then he reached for a volume on the Lord’s Prayer—the *Our Father*—written recently by a priest in Saint Petersburg. We began reading it together with great pleasure.

Shortly after, the mistress of the house brought us tea, and the children carried in a large silver basket filled with biscuits or pastries I had never before tasted. The husband took the book from me, handed it to his wife, and said, “Since she reads so beautifully, we shall have her read to us while we enjoy some refreshment.”

She began reading aloud, and as I listened, I was able to attend simultaneously to the prayer in my heart. The more she read, the stronger my inner prayer grew, filling me with deep delight. Suddenly, it seemed as though someone passed swiftly before my eyes—through the air—as if it were my late *starets*. I shuddered but, not wanting to reveal this, I quickly said, “Forgive me, I must have dozed off.”

At that moment, I felt as if the *starets*’ spirit had penetrated my own, illuminating it. A sudden enlightenment came upon my understanding, and a multitude of thoughts about prayer filled my mind. I made the sign of the cross over myself to banish these thoughts just as the mistress finished reading. Her husband then asked if I had enjoyed it, and we began to discuss the book.

“I liked it very much,” I said. “The Lord’s Prayer—the *Our Father*—is more exalted and precious than all the prayers recorded by Christians, for it was given to us by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. The commentary was very good, though it focused mainly on Christian works. In my reading of the holy Fathers, I have also encountered contemplative and mystical commentaries on this prayer.”

“In which of the Fathers did you find these teachings?” they asked.

“Well, for example, in Saint Maximus the Confessor, and also in the *Philokalia* through the writings of Saint Peter of Damascus,” I replied.

“Do you remember any of what you read? Please, tell us about it!”

“Certainly! Let us consider the very first words of the prayer: *Our Father, Who art in heaven.* The book we read today offered one interpretation, saying these words call us to brotherly love — to see all people as children of one Father. That is true, but the holy Fathers go even deeper. They teach that this phrase is an invitation to lift our minds to heaven, to the heavenly Father Himself, and to remember our sacred duty to live each moment in His presence.

“The words *hallowed be Thy Name* are explained in your book as a call to reverence — that the Name of God should never be spoken disrespectfully or taken in false oaths. Simply put, the holy Name must be spoken with awe and never in vain. Yet the mystical commentators see these words as a direct request for the gift of the interior prayer of the heart — a plea that the most holy Name of God be engraved upon the heart, hallowed by the self-active prayer, sanctifying all our feelings and spiritual powers.

“When we pray *Thy Kingdom come*, the mystical teachers interpret this as a yearning that inner peace, tranquility, and spiritual joy may descend into our hearts.

“Your book explains the petition *Give us this day our daily bread* as a request for the material necessities — not in excess, but enough to satisfy our needs and to help those in want. But Saint Maximus the Confessor offers a deeper meaning: he sees daily bread as the nourishment of the soul with the heavenly bread — the Word of God — and the union of the soul with God through constant remembrance of Him and the ceaseless interior prayer of the heart.”

“Ah! That is a great thing to aspire to,” exclaimed the master of the house, “but it seems nearly impossible for those of us living in the world to attain this interior prayer! Most of the time, we’re just grateful if the Lord helps us to say our prayers at all, without falling into laziness.”

“Do not see it as something unattainable, Batyushka,” I replied gently. “If it truly were overwhelmingly difficult, God would not have commanded all of us to pursue it. His strength is made perfect in our weakness. The holy Fathers, from their own experience, provide us with ways and methods that make it easier to enter into the prayer of the heart. Of course, hermits have special, more advanced practices, but there are also accessible methods designed for laypeople that faithfully guide us to this prayer.”

“I have never encountered anything so detailed in my readings,” the master said thoughtfully.

“If you like,” I offered, “I can read to you from the *Philokalia*.”

I retrieved my *Philokalia*, found the article by Saint Peter of Damascus in section three, and read aloud:

“‘More important than attending to your breathing, one must learn to call upon the Name of God at all times, in all places, and during all activities. The Apostle teaches us to pray without ceasing — to remember God constantly, no matter where you are or what you are doing. If you are busy with some task, remember the Creator of all. When you see the light, recall the One who gives it. When you look at the sky, the earth, the waters, and all their contents, marvel and glorify the Creator. As you put on your clothes, remember Him who gifts them to you, and thank Him for all your provisions. In short, let every action be an opportunity to remember and praise God. And before you realize it, you will be praying without ceasing, and your soul will rejoice continually.’”

“Do you see now how this method to attain unceasing prayer is convenient, simple, and within reach of anyone with a heart open to God?”
