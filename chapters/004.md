> *But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord God my refuge…*
> —Psalm 73:28

When I came to visit my spiritual father, I said,
“How true it is, what the old Russian proverb says: *‘Man proposes, but God disposes.’*
I had every intention of leaving today, beginning my journey to the holy city of Jerusalem. But something entirely unexpected happened. A small event—completely unforeseen—has kept me here for three more days. And I couldn’t resist coming to see you, Father, to ask your advice about how to handle it. Let me tell you what happened.

After I had said my farewells and entrusted myself to God, I set out with a light heart. But just as I was passing through the city gates, I saw a familiar face standing in the doorway of the last house. It was a fellow pilgrim—someone I hadn’t seen in three years. We greeted each other warmly, and he asked where I was headed.

“I’m hoping to reach old Jerusalem, God willing,” I replied.

“Thank God!” he said. “I know the perfect traveling companion for you!”

“God bless you and him,” I said, “but surely you remember—I’ve never traveled with companions. I’m used to walking alone.”

“Yes, yes, I know,” he said. “But listen—this companion would suit you perfectly. You see, I work in this very house, and the father of the master has also made a vow to visit Jerusalem. He’s a good man—older, humble, a bit deaf. In fact, he’s *very* deaf. You could shout your head off and he wouldn’t hear a thing. If you need to speak to him, you’d have to write it down on paper. So you won’t be bothered by chatter—he hardly talks at home either. But he could really use your help on the road.”

He went on, “His son is giving him a horse and wagon for the journey to Odessa. From there, he’ll sell both and continue on by ship. The old man wants to walk most of the way, but he needs the wagon for his belongings and a few gifts he’s bringing to the Lord’s tomb. You could even load your own knapsack onto the wagon—just think of it! And how could you let an old, deaf man go off all by himself on such a long road? It’s dangerous. He’s carrying some money and parcels, and we’ve been trying to find someone trustworthy to accompany him. But everyone wants too much in return—and none of them are right. You would be just the person. I’ll vouch for you to his family, and they’ll be thrilled. They’re good people. They care for me, and I’ve worked for them these past two years.”

We had been talking at the doorway, but then he brought me inside and introduced me to the master of the house. Right away, I could tell this was a good, honest family—humble, generous, full of decency. So I agreed to their offer. We planned to set out, God willing, on the third day after Christmas, right after the Divine Liturgy.

Isn’t it something how these unexpected turns happen in life? And yet, in all of it, God’s hand gently steers our course. As the Scriptures say, *“For God is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure”* (Philippians 2:13).

When I finished telling this story, my spiritual father smiled and said,
“I rejoice with all my heart, dear brother, that the Lord has let me see you again—so soon, and so unexpectedly! Since you still have some time before your journey, I ask you, lovingly, to stay a little longer. Tell me more about the spiritual lessons you’ve received during your long pilgrimage. I’ve listened with such delight to your stories.”

“I would be glad to,” I replied. And so I began to share again.

So many things have happened to me—both joyful and sorrowful—that I could never recount them all. Some I’ve even forgotten. My heart was always more drawn toward whatever awakened my lazy soul to prayer. The rest, I tried to leave behind. As the apostle Paul says, *“forgetting what lies behind and striving forward to what lies ahead”* (Philippians 3:13).

Even my blessed starets, of holy memory, used to teach that the greatest obstacles to prayer can come not only from evil, but from what appears good. He said the enemy will sometimes attack us “from the left”—through vain, sinful, or distracting thoughts. But when that fails, he attacks “from the right”—bringing us thoughts that seem uplifting, beautiful, even spiritual—just to keep us from true prayer.

This deception, he said, is known as “right-hand theft.” It tricks the soul into preferring spiritual ideas or consoling emotions over actual communion with God. Prayer becomes replaced by thinking *about* God, rather than being *with* God.

So he warned me to gently set aside even the most inspiring thoughts if they came during prayer. Even conversations or reflections that felt spiritually nourishing could become a kind of spiritual indulgence if they distracted me from the deeper stillness of the heart. He told me: if I ever noticed I was spending more time talking *about* prayer than actually praying, or more time thinking spiritually than resting in God’s presence, I should recognize that—even this—can be a subtle form of ego, a craving for “spiritual sweets.”

Especially for beginners, he said, prayer must come first. Always. Our time spent in hidden, interior prayer must be more than any other pious activity, no matter how good it seems. For without prayer, we are like lamps without oil—shining for a moment, but unable to stay lit.

Still, not everything can or should be forgotten. Some encounters etch themselves so deeply in the heart that they remain clear in memory for years, even if we don’t dwell on them often.

I’ll tell you now about one such experience—a moment of grace that lives on in me like a warm light.

While I was traveling through the Tobolsk province, I came upon a town where my last piece of dried bread was nearly gone. I stopped at a house and humbly asked if they could spare a little food.

The man who answered smiled and said, “Thank God you came at just the right time! My wife has just taken fresh bread out of the oven. Here—take this warm loaf. And please, pray for us.”

I gratefully thanked him, and as I was putting the bread into my worn knapsack, his wife caught sight of me and said, “Look at that poor bag—it’s falling apart! Let me give you another.” She brought out a sturdy one and gave it to me with such kindness. Their generosity filled me with quiet joy. I thanked them both from the bottom of my heart and continued on my way.

Just outside the town, I stopped at a little shop and asked for some salt. The shopkeeper gave me a small bag for free. With bread and salt in hand, I rejoiced in spirit, whispering thanks to God for such unexpected blessings. I would not need to worry about food for a whole week! I could sleep in peace, with no hunger troubling my prayer.

*Bless the Lord, O my soul!* I said over and over.

A few miles down the road, I reached a poor village. There, standing humbly by the path, was a wooden church. Though small, its walls were painted with simple but beautiful frescoes. As I passed, a quiet tug in my heart drew me inside to pray.

I stepped onto the porch and stood for a moment in silence, offering my thanks to God. Two children—perhaps five or six years old—were playing nearby in the grass. They were beautifully dressed, so I assumed they must be the priest’s children.

I finished praying and turned to go. But just as I walked away, I heard voices behind me:

“*Dear beggarman! Dear beggarman, wait!*”

I turned around and saw the children—one boy, one girl—running toward me, bright-eyed and full of joy. Each took one of my hands and said, “Come with us to Mommy—she loves the poor!”

I gently replied, “But I’m not a beggar—I’m just a pilgrim, a man passing through.”

Still, they insisted, pulling me along with innocent determination.

“Then why do you carry a knapsack?” they asked with curiosity.

“I keep bread in there for the road,” I told them, smiling. “But tell me, where is your mother?”

“She’s just behind the church,” they said, tugging at my hands, “in the big house behind that little grove of trees.”

They led me through a lovely garden to a grand manor set in the middle, and we stepped inside. Everything was clean, quiet, and filled with a peaceful order. Their mother—the mistress of the house—came rushing to meet us with open arms.

“Welcome! Welcome! From where has God sent you to us?” she exclaimed warmly. “Come in, dear sir, come in and sit!”

She gently lifted the knapsack from my shoulders, placed it on the table, and led me to sit in a soft, comfortable chair.

“Would you like something to eat? A cup of tea? Is there anything you need at all?”

I looked at her with heartfelt gratitude and replied, “I thank you most humbly. I have bread enough in my sack, and while I do drink tea, we peasants aren’t really used to it. Your generous welcome and the kindness in your heart are far more precious to me than anything I could be served. I will ask God to bless you, for you live with the spirit of Scripture—the love of pilgrims and strangers.”

As I spoke those words, I felt the fire of prayer begin to burn brightly in my heart again. The inward flame rekindled, rising like a holy tide. I longed to be alone, to give full attention to the sweetness of prayer that was blossoming within me.

So I stood up gently and said, “Please forgive me, Matushka—it is time for me to take my leave. May the Lord Jesus Christ be with you and with your dear children.”

And with that, I made my way quietly out, eager to return to the solitude where I could be alone with my Beloved, in the silence of unceasing prayer.

“Oh no! God forbid that you should leave—I simply won’t allow it,” the mistress said, her voice full of warmth. “My husband is coming home from the city this evening—he’s a judge—and he will be overjoyed to meet you. He considers every pilgrim to be a messenger from God. If you go now, he’ll be so disappointed not to have met you.”

“Besides,” she continued, “tomorrow is Sunday. You can pray with us at the Divine Liturgy, and afterward we’ll share whatever meal the Lord has provided. On every feast day, we open our home to guests—sometimes as many as thirty of Christ’s poor. But you haven’t even told me anything about yourself—where you’ve come from, where you’re going! Stay and talk with me. I love to hear devout people speak of spiritual things. Children, children! Take the pilgrim’s knapsack and place it in the chapel—he will sleep there tonight.”

I was astonished by her kindness and hospitality. I thought to myself: *Am I speaking with a human being or an angel?*

So I stayed.

That evening, I met her husband, the master of the house. I told him a little about my journey and my plans to travel on to Irkutsk.

“In that case,” said the mistress, “you’ll pass through Tobolsk. My mother is there—she is now a schima nun and lives at the women’s monastery. We’ll write a letter of introduction for you, and she will gladly receive you. Many seek her out for spiritual counsel. Oh! And you can bring her the book she asked us to order from Moscow—*The Ladder of Divine Ascent* by Saint John Climacus. How beautifully all of this is coming together!”

When it was time for dinner, I joined them at the table, along with four other women. After the first course, one of the ladies stood up, made a deep bow before the icons and then to those of us at the table. She brought in the second course and sat again. Another woman rose and did the same before serving the third course.

Watching all this with quiet wonder, I leaned toward the mistress and asked, “If I may, little mother—are these women your relatives?”

She smiled. “No, but they are sisters to me in Christ. This one is our cook, the second is the coachman’s wife, the third is the housekeeper, and the fourth is my maid. They’re all married—there isn’t a single unmarried girl in my house.”

Having observed and listened to everything, I was even more astonished. I thanked God for bringing me to such devout people and felt the intense activity of prayer burning in my heart. Eager to be alone so as not to disturb this sacred prayer, I rose from the table and said to the mistress, “No doubt you will want to rest after dinner. I am accustomed to taking a walk, so I will stroll around the garden.”

“No,” she replied gently, “I do not need to rest. I will walk with you in the garden, and you can tell me something edifying. If you go alone, the children will pester you—once they see you, they won’t leave your side, for they truly love the needy brethren of Christ and pilgrims.”

With no way to refuse, I went with her. Seeking to avoid speaking about myself, I bowed before her and said, “Matushka, in the name of God, please tell me how long you have lived such a devout life and how you have achieved such piety.”

She smiled and began, “Perhaps I should tell you the whole story of my life. You see, my mother is the great-granddaughter of Saint Joasaph, whose relics rest in Belogorod and are open for veneration. We once owned a large townhouse and rented one wing to a nobleman who was not well off. When he died, his widow was pregnant, but she passed away shortly after giving birth. My mother took pity on the poor orphaned child and raised him alongside me. I was born one year later. We grew up together, studied under the same tutors, and became as close as brother and sister.”

She continued, “Some years later, my father died, and my mother moved from the city to this country estate. When we reached adulthood, my mother gave me in marriage to this orphaned young man who had grown up in our house. She settled her entire estate on us and then entered a monastery, where she had a cell built for herself. In her blessing, she exhorted us to live as true Christians: to pray earnestly to God, to love our neighbors, to care for Christ’s needy brethren with simplicity and humility, to raise our children in the fear of God, and to treat our servants as brothers.”

She paused and then added, “We have lived here by ourselves for the last ten years, striving to follow her instructions. We maintain a guesthouse for the poor, and at this moment, more than ten crippled and needy people reside with us. Perhaps tomorrow you will visit them with me.”

When she had finished her story, I asked, “Where is that book by Saint John of the Ladder that you wanted delivered to your mother?”

“Let’s go inside, and I will find it for you.”

No sooner had we settled down to read than the master of the house arrived. Upon seeing me, he embraced me warmly, and we exchanged the Christian kiss of peace. Then he led me into his own room and said, “Come, dear brother, to my study and bless my cell. I think you have had enough of her”—he gestured toward his wife—“for as soon as she sees a pilgrim or someone who is ill, she gladly spends day and night with them. This has been the way of her entire family for generations.”

We entered his study. It was filled with many books and magnificent icons, alongside a life-giving crucifix bearing a life-sized figure of Christ, with a Bible resting nearby. I prayed quietly, then said to him, “Sir, what you have here is God’s paradise. Here stands the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, His Most Pure Mother, and His holy saints; and these”—I pointed to the books—“are their divinely inspired, living words and teachings, which can never be silenced. I expect you enjoy frequent spiritual converse with them.”

“Yes, I admit it,” the master replied. “I do love to read.”

“What sort of books do you have here?” I asked.

“I have many spiritual books,” he replied. “Here is the *Chet’-Minei* for the entire year, the works of Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Basil the Great. There are numerous theological and philosophical treatises, as well as collections of sermons by the most celebrated preachers of recent times. My library is valued at five thousand rubles.”

“By any chance, do you have a book about prayer?” I asked.

“I love to read about prayer,” he answered. Then he reached for a volume on the Lord’s Prayer—the *Our Father*—written recently by a priest in Saint Petersburg. We began reading it together with great pleasure.

Shortly after, the mistress of the house brought us tea, and the children carried in a large silver basket filled with biscuits or pastries I had never before tasted. The husband took the book from me, handed it to his wife, and said, “Since she reads so beautifully, we shall have her read to us while we enjoy some refreshment.”

She began reading aloud, and as I listened, I was able to attend simultaneously to the prayer in my heart. The more she read, the stronger my inner prayer grew, filling me with deep delight. Suddenly, it seemed as though someone passed swiftly before my eyes—through the air—as if it were my late *starets*. I shuddered but, not wanting to reveal this, I quickly said, “Forgive me, I must have dozed off.”

At that moment, I felt as if the *starets*’ spirit had penetrated my own, illuminating it. A sudden enlightenment came upon my understanding, and a multitude of thoughts about prayer filled my mind. I made the sign of the cross over myself to banish these thoughts just as the mistress finished reading. Her husband then asked if I had enjoyed it, and we began to discuss the book.

“I liked it very much,” I said. “The Lord’s Prayer—the *Our Father*—is more exalted and precious than all the prayers recorded by Christians, for it was given to us by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. The commentary was very good, though it focused mainly on Christian works. In my reading of the holy Fathers, I have also encountered contemplative and mystical commentaries on this prayer.”

“In which of the Fathers did you find these teachings?” they asked.

“Well, for example, in Saint Maximus the Confessor, and also in the *Philokalia* through the writings of Saint Peter of Damascus,” I replied.

“Do you remember any of what you read? Please, tell us about it!”

“Certainly! Let us consider the very first words of the prayer: *Our Father, Who art in heaven.* The book we read today offered one interpretation, saying these words call us to brotherly love — to see all people as children of one Father. That is true, but the holy Fathers go even deeper. They teach that this phrase is an invitation to lift our minds to heaven, to the heavenly Father Himself, and to remember our sacred duty to live each moment in His presence.

“The words *hallowed be Thy Name* are explained in your book as a call to reverence — that the Name of God should never be spoken disrespectfully or taken in false oaths. Simply put, the holy Name must be spoken with awe and never in vain. Yet the mystical commentators see these words as a direct request for the gift of the interior prayer of the heart — a plea that the most holy Name of God be engraved upon the heart, hallowed by the self-active prayer, sanctifying all our feelings and spiritual powers.

“When we pray *Thy Kingdom come*, the mystical teachers interpret this as a yearning that inner peace, tranquility, and spiritual joy may descend into our hearts.

“Your book explains the petition *Give us this day our daily bread* as a request for the material necessities — not in excess, but enough to satisfy our needs and to help those in want. But Saint Maximus the Confessor offers a deeper meaning: he sees daily bread as the nourishment of the soul with the heavenly bread — the Word of God — and the union of the soul with God through constant remembrance of Him and the ceaseless interior prayer of the heart.”

“Ah! That is a great thing to aspire to,” exclaimed the master of the house, “but it seems nearly impossible for those of us living in the world to attain this interior prayer! Most of the time, we’re just grateful if the Lord helps us to say our prayers at all, without falling into laziness.”

“Do not see it as something unattainable, Batyushka,” I replied gently. “If it truly were overwhelmingly difficult, God would not have commanded all of us to pursue it. His strength is made perfect in our weakness. The holy Fathers, from their own experience, provide us with ways and methods that make it easier to enter into the prayer of the heart. Of course, hermits have special, more advanced practices, but there are also accessible methods designed for laypeople that faithfully guide us to this prayer.”

“I have never encountered anything so detailed in my readings,” the master said thoughtfully.

“If you like,” I offered, “I can read to you from the *Philokalia*.”

I retrieved my *Philokalia*, found the article by Saint Peter of Damascus in section three, and read aloud:

“‘More important than attending to your breathing, one must learn to call upon the Name of God at all times, in all places, and during all activities. The Apostle teaches us to pray without ceasing — to remember God constantly, no matter where you are or what you are doing. If you are busy with some task, remember the Creator of all. When you see the light, recall the One who gives it. When you look at the sky, the earth, the waters, and all their contents, marvel and glorify the Creator. As you put on your clothes, remember Him who gifts them to you, and thank Him for all your provisions. In short, let every action be an opportunity to remember and praise God. And before you realize it, you will be praying without ceasing, and your soul will rejoice continually.’”

“Do you see now how this method to attain unceasing prayer is convenient, simple, and within reach of anyone with a heart open to God?”

They were deeply moved by what they heard. The master embraced me joyfully and thanked me with real warmth. Then, flipping through my *Philokalia*, he said, “I’ll order this from Petersburg as soon as I can. But for now, I’ll copy that passage so I don’t forget it. Please, read it to me again.”

He listened closely as I read it once more, then quickly and neatly wrote it down. Suddenly he exclaimed, “My God! I even have an icon of the holy Damascene!” (It was likely Saint John of Damascus.) He picked up a picture frame, slipped the handwritten passage behind the glass, and hung it beneath the icon.

“There,” he said with a smile, “the living words of one of God’s saints, hanging right under his image. Now I’ll be reminded every day to put his life-giving counsel into practice.”

Later we sat down for dinner, joined by the same gathering of men and women. The table was filled with a deep and peaceful silence—a reverence that wrapped around us like a gentle cloak. After the meal, everyone, young and old, gathered for prayer. They asked me to chant the *Akathist to the Most Sweet Jesus*, and we prayed together for a long time.

Once the prayers were finished, the servants retired for the night. The three of us remained in the room a little longer. The mistress brought me a clean white shirt and a pair of socks. I bowed low and said, “Matushka, I’ll gratefully accept the shirt, but I’ve never worn socks in my life. We peasants are used to *onoochi*.”

Without hesitation, she left the room and returned with an old robe made of thin yellow fabric. She tore it in two and fashioned a pair of *onoochi* from it. Her husband, looking at my worn-out footwear, said kindly, “Look at this poor man's shoes—barely holding together.” He brought out a pair of his own *bashmaki*, new and large enough to wear over boots.

“Go change in the next room,” he said. I did as he asked, and when I came back, they sat me down and began dressing my feet themselves. The master wrapped the *onoochi* gently around my feet, while his wife helped him pull on the *bashmaki*.

At first, I protested, feeling shy and unworthy. But they quieted me, saying, “Sit still and be at peace—Christ washed the feet of His disciples.”

I could do nothing but weep. And they wept with me.

Later, the mistress retired with the children, and the master and I made our way to the little summerhouse in the garden.

We weren’t tired yet, so we lay there in the quiet summerhouse, talking late into the night. Eventually, the master turned to me with a serious look and said, “Now be honest—with God as your witness and with a clear conscience. Who are you, really? You must come from a good family and have chosen to live as a fool for Christ. The way you read and write, the way you speak so thoughtfully and clearly—it’s not the kind of learning that comes from a peasant’s life.”

I looked at him and said, “Truly, I told you and your wife everything from my heart. I had no reason to lie, and I wouldn’t. Everything I’ve shared isn’t mine, not really. It’s what I was taught by my blessed starets, who was full of wisdom from God, and what I’ve read slowly and carefully in the writings of the holy Fathers. I’m just passing it on.

“But more than anything, it’s interior prayer that’s opened my eyes—though I can’t take credit for that either. It was the Lord’s mercy, through my starets’ gentle guidance, that awakened it in me. And this, I believe, is something anyone can receive. You simply need to become quiet inside, descend into your heart, and start calling on the name of Jesus with faith and humility. Before long, a light begins to shine from within, and your understanding opens like a flower in the sun. You start to see things more clearly—even the hidden things of the Kingdom of God begin to make sense in your soul.

“To be able to enter your own heart, to see your true self, to feel that discovery with joy—and at the same time be moved to tears over how far you’ve wandered from your original goodness—that alone is a profound mystery. And once you touch that place inside, you find you can speak wisely with others too. Because wisdom doesn’t come first from schooling—it comes from the mind and heart God gave us from the beginning.

“Learning can shape the mind, yes, but only if there’s a heart that’s awake and ready. Where there’s no understanding, no awakening, no amount of books or discipline can help. The truth is, we’ve grown distant from ourselves. We rarely want to face who we truly are. Instead, we run from it, filling our days with empty distractions. We tell ourselves we’d love to live a more spiritual life, we’d love to pray more—but there’s just never enough time. We’re too busy worrying about this and that.

“But really, what could be more important than the eternal soul? This short life of ours, which we spend fussing over constantly, will pass away. The soul lasts forever. And that’s what I meant when I spoke of the difference between good judgment and foolishness.”

“Forgive me, dear brother,” he said gently, “I didn’t mean to question you out of mere curiosity. It came from a heartfelt sense of Christian concern—and also because of something that happened two years ago, which your words reminded me of.

“A beggar came to our home. He had a military discharge passport, was old and frail, and so poor that his clothes barely covered him and he had almost nothing on his feet. He didn’t talk much and spoke so simply that we assumed he was just a peasant from the steppes.

“We let him stay in our little guesthouse for the poor. But after about five days, he became very ill. So my wife and I moved him into this summerhouse and began to care for him ourselves. When it became clear he was near death, we called for our priest. He came and heard his confession, gave him Communion, and administered Holy Unction.

“Then, the day before the man died, something unexpected happened. He got up from his bed, asked for paper and a pen, and requested that we lock the door and let no one in while he wrote his final will and testament to his son. He gave us an address in Saint Petersburg and asked that we send it there after his death.

“I was amazed—not only was his handwriting graceful and refined, but his writing style was elegant, thoughtful, and perfectly composed. Tomorrow I’ll read it to you—I kept a copy.

“All of this made me deeply curious. So I gently asked him about his past. He made me promise not to reveal anything while he was alive. And then, to the glory of God, he told me the story of his life.”

He continued:

“I was once a very wealthy prince, living in splendor and indulgence, completely absorbed in a life of luxury and excess. After my wife died, I lived alone with my only son, who was doing well—he had earned the rank of captain in the Guards.

“One evening, as we were getting ready to attend a grand ball at the home of an influential noble, I lost my temper with my valet. In a sudden outburst of anger, I struck him violently on the head and ordered that he be sent back to his village.

“The next day, the valet died—his brain inflamed from the blow. But at the time, I felt only a momentary regret. I quickly forgot about it, brushing the whole matter aside.

“But about six weeks later, something began to happen. The valet started to appear to me—at first in my dreams. Night after night, he would come, staring at me and repeating, *‘Wretched man! You are my murderer!’*

“Soon, it wasn’t only in dreams. I began to see him when I was fully awake. The more time passed, the more frequently he appeared, until it seemed he was haunting me without pause.

“But he wasn’t alone for long. I began to see others too—men I had wronged, women I had seduced and abandoned. They surrounded me, accusing me, tormenting me, day and night. There was no escape.

“I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t live. I withered away to nothing. No doctor could help, no remedy eased my suffering.

“In desperation, I went abroad, hoping that new treatments might save me. But after six months, nothing had changed. In fact, the visions grew worse, more relentless. I returned home half-alive, a shell of a man.

“It was then that I knew—without any doubt—that hell exists. Not just as some idea or future judgment, but as a real, living torment. My soul had tasted its fires, while still in this body.”

"In the middle of his anguish, the man came face-to-face with the weight of his own choices. He confessed his wrongs, repented deeply, and released all his servants. Then he made a vow—not out of punishment, but out of a sincere desire to walk humbly: that for the rest of his life, he would take on hardship and live in poverty, offering himself in service to those the world tends to overlook.

And something miraculous happened.

The torment lifted. All the dark, haunting visions disappeared. In their place came a peace so deep, so radiant, that he couldn’t put it fully into words. He described it as tasting paradise itself—like the Kingdom of God had quietly opened its gates inside his own heart.

His body healed, and his soul was made light.

Without any fanfare or farewell, he set out to fulfill the promise he had made. He left his homeland, traveling alone across the vast expanse of Siberia. For fifteen years, he wandered. Sometimes he worked for humble folk, doing whatever small jobs he could. Other times he simply begged for food, asking in the name of Christ.

And yet, through all of it—all the lack, the cold, the uncertainty—he was *happy*. Deeply, sincerely happy. He said that only someone who’s been dragged through their own personal hell and then lifted into God’s mercy could understand the peace he carried.

Before he died, he handed me a letter—a will, really—and asked me to send it to his son. I still keep a copy tucked into my Bible. Would you like to read it? I have it here.

---

*In the name of God, glorified in the Trinity—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.*

*My dearest son,*

*It’s been fifteen years since you last saw me. Though I’ve had no word from you, I’ve heard little whispers about your life, and through it all, I’ve held you in the quiet place of a father’s love. That love compels me now to send these final words from my deathbed, in hopes that something in them might serve you well.*

*You know something of the pain I endured from living thoughtlessly. But you don’t yet know the joy I found in repentance. My years of wandering—though poor and unknown—were filled with a kind of bliss I never expected. There’s sweetness in a soul made clean.*

*I’m dying peacefully now, in the home of someone who showed kindness not just to me, but to you as well. When you’re able, express your thanks to him in whatever way feels true.*

*I leave you my blessing, and with it, this charge: Always remember God. Keep your conscience clear. Be wise. Be gentle. Be fair. Be kind to those who serve under you, and never look down on the poor or the homeless. Remember that your father, broken and tormented, found his healing only by walking the path of poverty and pilgrimage.*

*I now close my eyes in peace, trusting in the mercy of our Intercessor, Jesus Christ, and in the hope of eternal life.*

*Your father*

---

The kind man and I lay together in the garden summerhouse, chatting in the gentle quiet of the afternoon. After a time, I asked him something that had been on my mind.

“Tell me, Batyushka,” I said, “doesn’t running a guesthouse for pilgrims bring its share of trouble? I mean, I’ve met my fair share of wanderers who are just drifting, with no real aim—or worse, too lazy to work. Some even stir up trouble along the way. I’ve seen it myself.”

He gave a little nod, but his eyes stayed soft. “We don’t get too many like that,” he said. “Most who come here are genuine. Still, when the difficult ones do arrive, we actually make a point to welcome them even more warmly—and encourage them to stay longer.”

I looked at him, curious.

“Often,” he continued, “when they spend time living among the poor in spirit—among Christ’s own beggars—they begin to change. The rough edges soften. They leave our care different than when they arrived—quieter, humbler. More human, you could say.”

He told me about one man in particular. He’d been from a local middle-class family, but had fallen into such disgrace that even the kindest townspeople chased him away with sticks. No one would feed him, not even a crust of bread. He was known for being violent, drunk, and prone to stealing.

One day, utterly worn down and hungry, the man came to their doorstep and asked for some bread—and wine, of course, as that was his craving above all.

“We received him with kindness,” the master said. “We told him, ‘You’re welcome to stay. You’ll get all the wine you want—but only if you promise that when you’ve had your fill, you’ll quietly go to sleep. If you stir up any trouble, that’s it—we’ll not only send you away for good, but I’ll personally report you to the magistrate and have you taken to a penal colony.’”

The man agreed. And true to his word, he drank—freely and deeply—for over a week. But each time he got drunk, he simply stumbled off to bed or lay down quietly in the garden. He kept his end of the deal, mostly because he couldn’t bear the thought of losing access to the wine.

And then something started to shift.

His fellow beggars, many of whom had walked through their own valleys, gently encouraged him to try drinking less. They didn’t scold—they just invited him, bit by bit, to imagine something better. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, he began to drink less. And then one day—three months later—he stopped altogether.

He found work. He stopped begging.

And just two days before our conversation, he had come by to say thank you.

As I listened to his story, I was filled with wonder. *What wisdom,* I thought, *has been shaped here—not by control or harshness, but by love.* I couldn’t help but say aloud, “Blessed be God, who has revealed His mercy in this home you care for!”

After our talk, the master and I dozed off for a little while—maybe an hour, maybe more—until the soft ringing of the bell called us to matins. We rose quietly and made our way to the church.

When we stepped inside, I noticed his wife was already there with the children, settled in silence. We stayed for matins and then the Divine Liturgy that followed. The master and I stood with the little boy inside the altar area, while his wife and daughter knelt near the altar window, hoping to catch a glimpse of the holy mystery as the Gifts were elevated.

And then—oh, my God—how they prayed.

With heads bowed and hearts wide open, they wept. Not with sorrow, but with joy—tears pouring down their faces as if heaven itself had touched them. Their faces glowed with such pure light that I couldn’t help myself… my own eyes filled with tears too, overflowing just from witnessing the beauty of it.

There’s something about that kind of prayer—quiet, honest, full of longing and love—that opens a door inside you. Even as an onlooker, you’re pulled into its grace.

After the Liturgy, everyone made their way to the dining room—the master and mistress, the priest, the servants, and all the beggars who had come for shelter. There must have been forty of them: some crippled, others frail, children nestled among them. Yet they all sat together, shoulder to shoulder, at one long table.

What struck me most wasn’t the number of people or the food, but the *stillness*. A deep, almost sacred quiet filled the room, as if peace itself had joined us at the table.

Feeling a little bold, I leaned over to the master and said softly, “In monasteries, they often read from the lives of the saints during meals. You have the full collection—you might consider doing the same.”

He turned to his wife with a smile and said, “Masha, why don’t we start that? It would be good for everyone. I’ll read first—at this meal—and then you can read next. Then our friend Batyushka here can take a turn. After that, anyone else who can read is welcome to join in.”

The priest, who was quietly eating nearby, looked up and said, “Oh, I do love to listen. But reading? Well, forgive me, but I simply don’t have the time for it. The moment I get home there’s always something that needs doing. Children calling, cows to tend to, endless small things that pile up. I’ve got so many daily duties that I hardly remember the theology I studied in seminary.”

At that, a strange feeling passed through me—something between surprise and sorrow. But before I could say anything, the mistress gently took my hand and whispered, “He speaks this way out of humility. Always has. He may downplay himself, but he is righteous. Kind beyond words. He’s been a widower for twenty years and has raised a whole household of grandchildren—while still serving in the church, offering the sacraments faithfully and often.”

Her words brought to mind something I had once read in the *Philokalia*, from Nikitas Stethatos. He wrote, “The nature of things is measured by the interior disposition of the soul”—that is, how we see others depends on the state of our own heart. He goes on to say, *“He who has attained to genuine prayer and love no longer puts things into categories. He does not separate the righteous from the sinners, but loves all equally and does not judge them—just as God causes the sun to shine and the rain to fall on both the just and the unjust.”*

Those words settled in me again as I looked around the table. No distinctions. No judgments. Just people, gathered in the quiet love of God.

A quiet hush settled over the room again. Across from me sat a completely blind beggar, one of the guests staying at the house. The master, with his usual gentle care, fed him—cutting pieces of fish, guiding the spoon to his mouth, making sure he was nourished.

I found myself watching this man closely. His mouth stayed slightly open, and his tongue moved constantly, fluttering as though it trembled. Something about it caught my attention. I wondered if he might be one of those hidden souls—someone deep in prayer without drawing any notice. The thought stayed with me, and I kept quietly observing him.

But the peace of that moment was interrupted. One of the older women at the table suddenly became ill and began to moan in pain. Without hesitation, the master and his wife carried her into their bedroom and laid her down gently on the bed. The wife stayed at her side, and the priest went off to retrieve the Presanctified Gifts—just in case. The master called for his carriage to fetch a doctor. The rest of us quietly slipped away.

As I walked out, I felt something stirring deep within—a wave of longing. It had been two full days since I’d been alone in silence, and the desire for stillness came over me like a tide ready to break. There was a fullness inside me, like a prayer swelling within my chest that had nowhere to go. I felt it pressing against my heart—almost painfully, though not in a way I wished to stop. It was a sweet kind of ache that could only be soothed by solitude… and by prayer.

In that moment, something became clear to me. I understood, even if just faintly, why those who are drawn deeply into the life of prayer often withdraw from the noise of daily life. Why they leave behind company, even good company, to hide away in the shelter of silence. There’s something in the heart that begins to beat differently when it tastes that stillness.

It reminded me of the words of Hesychios, who taught that even the most noble conversation can become idle chatter when we’ve had too much of it. And of Saint Ephraim the Syrian, who once said, *“Good speech is silver, but silence is pure gold.”*

And that day, I knew exactly what he meant.

As I reflected on everything, I made my way back to the guesthouse where everyone was resting after the meal. I climbed quietly into the attic, finding a calm space to settle, rest, and pray for a little while.

Later, when the beggars had risen from their rest, I sought out the blind man. We walked together just beyond the kitchen garden, found a quiet spot, and sat down to talk.

I asked him gently, “For God’s sake, would you tell me—do you pray the Jesus Prayer for your own spiritual benefit?”

He nodded. “I have been praying it unceasingly for a long time now.”

“What do you experience when you pray like this?”

He smiled softly. “Only that I cannot be without the prayer, day or night.”

Curious, I pressed further. “How did God reveal this practice to you? Tell me everything, dear brother.”

He began his story. “You see, I once belonged to a local guild and made my living as a tailor. I traveled from province to province, sewing clothes for peasants.

“One time, I stayed longer than usual in a village, living with a peasant family I was making clothes for. On one of the feast days, I noticed three books lying near their icon case. I asked, ‘Who in your household knows how to read?’ They told me, ‘No one. These books were left to us by our uncle, who could read and write.’

“I picked up one book and opened it randomly. There, on one page, I found these words—words I remember clearly to this day: ‘Unceasing prayer is calling always upon the Name of God, whether one is conversing or sitting down, walking, working, or eating, or occupied with any other activity—in all places and at all times one should call upon the Name of God.’

“After reading this, I thought to myself, ‘This might actually be something I can do.’ So I began quietly repeating the prayer in a soft whisper while I sewed—and I found it very comforting.

“The others living with me in the hut began to notice and mocked me. ‘What are you?’ they said. ‘Some kind of wizard? What are you whispering all the time? Are you weaving a spell?’ To keep my prayer private, I stopped moving my lips and began to pray only with my tongue.

“In time, it became so natural that day and night my tongue would form the words on its own. And this—this became a great comfort to me.”
