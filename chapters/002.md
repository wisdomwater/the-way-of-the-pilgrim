# Chapter 2

For a long time I wandered through many different places, always accompanied by the Jesus Prayer. No matter what I encountered—or who—I felt encouraged and comforted by the steady rhythm of that holy name in my heart and on my lips.

Eventually, I began to wonder if it might be better to settle down somewhere. I longed for enough time and solitude to study the *Philokalia* more deeply. I had read short passages here and there—whenever I stopped to rest at night or paused along the road during the day—but my heart ached to fully immerse myself in its pages. I hoped that, through the *Philokalia*, I might discover the way of salvation more clearly, guided by the prayer of the heart.

But as much as I wanted to find a place to stay, my circumstances made that difficult. I had a disability in my left arm that I’d had since early childhood, which made it hard to find any steady work. Without a way to support myself, I couldn’t manage a permanent home.

So I decided to head east, toward Siberia. I wanted to visit the grave of Saint Innocent of Irkutsk, and I imagined that the quiet of the Siberian forests and open steppes would be just the thing—less noise, fewer distractions, more space for prayer and study.

And so I set out once more, the Jesus Prayer quietly flowing from my lips with every step.

After a while, something beautiful began to happen. The prayer started to move from my lips into my heart. That is, while my heart beat in its natural rhythm, I sensed the words of the prayer echoing within it, gently and steadily: *Lord . . . Jesus . . . Christ . . .* — one word for each heartbeat.

So I stopped speaking the prayer aloud and instead listened, attentively and quietly, to the words of my heart. I remembered how my beloved starets had once told me how sweet this moment would be. And indeed, I began to feel a gentle tenderness deep in my chest—like a soft aching, but full of peace.

And then something even deeper stirred in me. My thoughts were filled with such love for Jesus Christ that it overwhelmed me. I imagined that if I were to see Him, I would fall at His feet and never let go—clinging to Him with tears and tenderness, kissing His feet in love and awe. I would thank Him from the depths of my soul for His mercy, for allowing even someone like me—unworthy and sinful—to taste such consolation through His holy name.

Then something wonderful happened. A gentle, wholesome warmth began to fill my heart, spreading gradually across my chest. It felt both comforting and holy, like being quietly embraced from the inside. This warmth stirred in me a desire to return to the *Philokalia*—not only to deepen my understanding of the prayer of the heart, but also to verify what I was now experiencing. I felt a cautious concern: what if I mistook this natural warmth for the grace-filled work of God? My late starets had warned me that such missteps—confusing spiritual progress with mere emotional experiences—could lead to pride and delusion. I wanted to be sure.

So I shifted my rhythm. I began walking mostly at night and spending my days seated under the shelter of the trees, reading the *Philokalia* with care and reverence. Oh, the wisdom it opened to me! So many things I’d never known, so many insights that felt like dew to my soul. The more I read and practiced, the more I tasted a sweetness I hadn’t even imagined before. The kind of sweetness that doesn't just touch the tongue—it fills the spirit.

It’s true that some of the teachings were still beyond me. My mind, dull and untrained as it was, couldn’t grasp everything at once. But the prayer itself—the living, breathing repetition of the name of Jesus—began to clarify what I couldn’t understand with reason alone. At times, in dreams, my dear starets would come to me and explain things gently, guiding me as if he had never left my side. Most of all, he would stir my heart toward humility.

For over two months that summer, I lived in this hidden bliss—walking the forests and backroads, praying as I went. When I reached a village, I would humbly ask for a bit of dry bread for my knapsack and a pinch of salt. I’d fill my little bark jar with water and continue walking—sometimes nearly seventy miles—sustained by little more than prayer and grace.

But perhaps, as I now reflect, there was still something lacking in me. Maybe it was due to the lingering sins of my broken soul, or maybe I still needed greater humility and guidance. For just as the season was coming to a close, I was met with a trial.

One evening, I had come out onto a main road as the sun was setting. Two men approached from behind. They looked like soldiers from their haircuts, and soon they fell in step beside me. Without much preamble, they began demanding money. I told them honestly, “I don’t have a penny.” But they didn’t believe me.

“You’re lying!” one of them barked. “Pilgrims always get plenty of money!”

The other sneered. “Enough talking.” Then, without warning, he struck me hard across the head with a club.

And with that, everything went black.

I don’t know how long I lay there unconscious, but when I finally came to, I found myself lying at the edge of a forest, just off the road. My clothes were in disarray, and my knapsack was gone. All that remained were the frayed ropes that had once held it on my back. But—thank God—they hadn’t taken my passport, which I’d tucked safely inside my old hat in case I ever needed to produce it quickly.

I slowly stood up and began to cry—not from the pain in my head, but from the anguish in my soul. My books were gone. My Bible and my *Philokalia*, which I had kept so close, had been stolen with the knapsack.

And so I wept. Day and night, I grieved deeply. Where was the Bible I had read since my early childhood, the one I had carried faithfully with me all this time? Where was the *Philokalia* that had offered such comfort and guidance, that had taught me how to pray? My heart broke under the weight of that loss. These books were my companions, my teachers, my very sustenance—and now they were gone. I hadn’t even finished learning from them. I thought to myself, *Why didn’t they just kill me instead of leaving me alive, empty-handed and starved of spiritual food?* What would I do now?

For two days I wandered, barely able to move, so overwhelmed was I by sorrow and loss. On the third day, utterly exhausted, I collapsed beneath a bush and fell into a heavy sleep.

In that sleep, I dreamed.

I saw myself back at the monastery, sitting once more in the cell of my dear starets. I was pouring out my grief to him, telling him everything. He looked at me with compassion and said gently, “Let this be a lesson to you in detachment from earthly possessions. It will help to loosen your grip on the world and ease your ascent toward heaven. This sorrow was permitted for your protection—to guard you from falling into spiritual gluttony.”

Then he added, “God asks the Christian for total surrender—a letting go of his own will, of his desires, of all attachments—so that he can become entirely available to the Divine. The Lord orders all things, even suffering, for the good and salvation of the soul. As it is written, “…who desires all men to be saved.”
—*1 Timothy 2:4*

“So take courage,” the starets said, “and believe that ‘with the temptation God will also provide the way of escape.’”
—*1 Corinthians 10:13*

“And you will soon be comforted in far greater measure than you now grieve.”

When I awoke from that dream, a deep calm had settled over me. My heart felt lighter, and a quiet strength stirred within my soul. I made the sign of the cross and whispered, “God’s will be done.” Then I stood up and resumed my journey. And as I walked, the prayer returned to my heart just as before—living, steady, and sweet.

For three days I traveled in peace, praying without ceasing.

Then, one day, I came upon a convoy of prisoners marching under guard. As I drew closer, to my amazement, I saw the very two men who had robbed me. They were walking at the edge of the group. I rushed up to them, threw myself at their feet, and begged them with all my heart to tell me what they had done with my books.

At first they acted as if I were invisible. But then one of them said, “We’ll tell you—for a price. Give us a ruble.”

“I swear to you,” I pleaded, “I’ll give you a ruble, even if I must beg for it in Christ’s name. Here—take my passport as a pledge if you like.”

At last they told me: my books had been taken and were now in the rear wagon, along with all the other stolen goods that had been confiscated from them.

“How can I get them back?” I asked.

“Speak to the captain,” they said.

I ran to the officer in charge and poured out my story—how I’d been robbed, and how my Bible and *Philokalia* were the only treasures I had in this life.

The captain listened thoughtfully, then asked, “Can you really read the Bible?”

“Not only can I read,” I answered, “but I can also write. You’ll see—my name is written in the Bible itself. And it matches the name in my passport.”

The captain nodded. “These two are deserters,” he said. “They’d been hiding out in a mud hut, robbing anyone they could find. They were caught just yesterday by a clever coachman who caught them trying to steal his three-horse team.”

He paused, then added, “Well, I suppose I’ll return your books to you, if they’re in the wagon. But you’ll need to walk with us to our next stop—it’s only a little over two miles ahead. We can’t delay the whole convoy just for your sake.”

I walked gladly beside the captain’s horse, and we struck up a conversation. He was older, with a kind and honest face, and I quickly saw that he was a good man. He asked about me—where I came from, where I was headed, and what kind of journey I was on. I answered every question truthfully, and before long we had arrived at the hut where the convoy would spend the night.

The captain went to the rear wagon, found my books, and returned them to me with a simple word: “Here they are.” Then he looked at the darkening sky and said, “Where will you go now, in the night? Stay here in the foyer.”

I could hardly contain my gratitude. Now that I had my Bible and my *Philokalia* again, I didn’t know how to thank God. I clutched them to my chest and held them so tightly that my arms went numb. Tears streamed down my face, and my heart beat with a tender joy.

The captain watched me quietly, then said, “It’s obvious that you love reading the Bible.”

I was so moved, I couldn’t speak. My tears flowed even more freely.

The captain continued, “Brother, I too read the Bible every day.” He unbuttoned his military coat and pulled out a small silver-bound Bible, printed in Kiev.

“Come, sit. I’ll tell you how I came to it.”

Then he called out, “How about some supper!”

We sat down together and he began his story.

“From the time I was a young man, I served in the army—not in some cushy garrison, but in active duty. I knew my job well and earned the rank of second lieutenant. My superiors liked me. But I was young, and so were my friends—and sadly, we all drank. At first it was just for fun, but soon I became completely dependent on alcohol. When I was sober, I was a model officer. But once I started drinking again, I was lost for weeks at a time, completely useless.

“They put up with it for a while. But one day, during a drunken outburst, I insulted a commanding officer. That was it. They demoted me to the rank of soldier and transferred me to a garrison post. I was warned: one more slip, and the consequences would be severe.

“I tried everything to stop drinking. I prayed, I fasted, I tried every cure I could find. But nothing worked. No matter what I did, I couldn’t overcome it. Eventually, they decided to put me under arrest.

“When I heard that…”
He paused, shaking his head.
“…I was at my wit’s end.”

“One day, as I sat in the barracks deep in thought, a monk came by, unexpectedly, collecting alms for the church. Each of us gave what we could. When he approached me, he paused and asked, ‘Why are you so sad?’

“We struck up a conversation, and I poured out all my woes to him. He listened with compassion and said, ‘The very same thing happened to my brother. Here’s what helped him: his spiritual father gave him a Bible and told him firmly that whenever he felt the urge to drink wine, he should immediately pick up the Bible and read a chapter. Every time the urge returned, he was to read yet another chapter. My brother followed this advice. And before long, the passion for alcohol left him completely. He hasn’t touched a drop in fifteen years. Why don’t you try the same? It’ll work—you’ll see. I have a Bible, and I’ll bring it to you.’

“I listened, but I replied, ‘How can your Bible help me when neither my efforts nor medical treatments have worked?’ I said this because I had never actually read the Bible.

“But the monk said, ‘Don’t say that. I assure you—it *will* help.’

“The next day, true to his word, he brought me his Bible. I opened it, looked through it, read a little, and said, ‘I won’t take it. I can’t understand a word. I’m not used to reading Church Slavonic.’

“But the monk insisted. ‘That doesn’t matter. These are the words of God Himself—they carry the power of grace. Just keep reading, even if you don’t understand everything. A saint once said, “If *you* don’t understand the words of God, *the evil spirits* do—and they tremble before them.” Your addiction to alcohol is surely the work of the devil. And here’s something else: Saint John Chrysostom wrote that even the *room* where a Bible is kept becomes a terror to the spirits of darkness. They can’t work their snares in a place where the Word of God dwells.’”

“I forget how much money I gave the monk, but I did accept his Bible. I tucked it away in a small trunk along with my other belongings—and then forgot about it.

“Some time later, I was once again overcome with a powerful urge to drink. The craving was so intense I felt as though I were dying for a taste of wine. I rushed to open my trunk, intending to grab some money and run to the tavern. But the first thing my eyes landed on was the Bible. In that moment, I remembered everything the monk had told me. I opened the book and began to read the first chapter of Matthew. I read the whole chapter, though I didn’t understand a word of it. Then I recalled the monk’s advice: *‘If you don’t understand it right away, keep on reading diligently.’*

“*All right,* I thought to myself, *I’ll read another chapter.* I did—and I began to understand. *Why not try a third chapter?* But just then, the barracks bell rang, signaling it was time for lights out. It was too late to go anywhere, so I stayed in.

“The next morning, I woke up still craving a drink. But then I thought, *What if I read a chapter from the Bible first?* I did—and stayed put. Later, when the urge returned, I read again—and felt better.

“This encouraged me so much that every time the desire to drink came upon me, I would turn to Scripture and read a chapter. The more I did this, the easier it became to resist. And when I had finally read through all four Gospels, the craving had left me completely. In fact, it had turned into an aversion. It has now been exactly twenty years since I last touched a drop of alcohol.”

Three years later, my officer’s rank was restored to me. In time, I was promoted again, until eventually I attained the rank of commanding officer. I married a kind and gentle woman, and we settled into a good life. *Thanks be to God,* we live peacefully, give to the poor when we can, and welcome pilgrims into our home. Why, even my son is an officer now—and a fine young man he is!

“Listen,” the captain continued, “from the moment I was freed from alcoholism, I made a vow: for the rest of my life, I would read the Bible—one Gospel every day, no matter how busy I was. And that is exactly what I’ve done. On days when I’m too exhausted to read it myself, I lie down and ask my wife or son to read an entire Gospel aloud to me, so I never miss a day. In thanksgiving to God—and to His glory—I had this Bible bound in pure silver. I carry it always in my breast pocket.”

I listened to the captain’s story with great delight and said, “I once knew someone with a very similar experience. In our village, there was a gifted craftsman who worked at the local factory. He was a good man and did beautiful, meticulous work—but sadly, he too struggled with drinking. A God-fearing man once suggested to him that whenever he felt the urge for wine, he should say the Jesus Prayer thirty-three times, in remembrance of the Holy Trinity and the thirty-three years of Jesus Christ’s earthly life. The craftsman took the advice to heart. He began saying the prayer—and not long after, he stopped drinking entirely. And that’s not all—three years later, he entered a monastery!”

The captain grew thoughtful. “Tell me,” he asked, “which is more exalted—the Jesus Prayer or the Bible?”

“It’s all the same,” I replied, “for the Divine Name of Jesus Christ contains within itself *all* the truths of the Bible. The holy Fathers say that the Jesus Prayer is the *abbreviated version of the entire Bible.*”

We said our evening prayers together, and the captain began reading aloud from the Gospel of Saint Mark, chapter one. I listened quietly, while in my heart I continued to pray the Jesus Prayer. At last, around two in the morning, he finished reading the Gospel, and we went to bed.

I rose early, as was my habit, and saw that everyone else was still asleep. As the first light of dawn crept over the land, I opened my beloved *Philokalia.* Oh, what joy welled up in my heart as I turned its pages! It felt as though I’d been reunited with someone I dearly loved—like a father or a friend returned to life. I kissed the book over and over and thanked God for giving it back to me. Then I turned to read the writings of Theophilus of Philadelphia in the second part of the *Philokalia.*

One sentence stood out to me with great force: *“While sitting in the refectory,” he writes, “give food to your body, give your attention to the reading of the day, and give your mind over to prayer.”* At first, this seemed impossible—to do three things at once. But then I remembered the joyful evening I had just shared with the captain, and I realized that what I had read was not only true—it was something I had already experienced. A mystery began to unfold before me: that the mind and the heart are not the same thing, but two distinct parts of the soul.

When the captain awoke, I thanked him sincerely for his kindness and prepared to continue on my way. He offered me some tea and gave me a ruble as a parting gift. We said our farewells, and I resumed my journey with joy in my heart.

I had walked no more than three-quarters of a mile when I remembered the promise I had made—to give those two soldiers a ruble if I ever got one. Now I had the means to keep that promise. But I hesitated. One thought argued, *“They beat you and robbed you! And they’re under arrest—they can’t even spend it.”* But another voice reminded me, *“If your enemy is hungry, feed him”* \[Rom. 12:20]. And again: *“Love your enemies”* \[Matt. 5:44]. Then I recalled the words of Jesus Himself: *“If anyone sues you and takes your coat, give him your cloak as well”* \[Matt. 5:40].

That settled it. I turned around and went back. The prisoners were just then being lined up for the next stage of their journey. I approached the two men and quietly placed the ruble into their hands. “Repent and pray,” I said. “Jesus Christ loves mankind—He will not abandon you.”

And with that, I turned and walked away, heading off in the opposite direction, my heart full and at peace.

After walking more than thirty-three miles along the main road, I felt a desire to turn off onto a quiet path where I could be alone and read. For a long time, I wandered through forests, encountering only the occasional small village. Often, I would spend an entire day in the stillness of the woods, sitting beneath the trees and carefully studying the *Philokalia.* I learned so many wondrous things from it. My heart was aflame with longing—a deep desire for union with God through interior prayer, a union I was now striving for under the guidance and confirmation of the *Philokalia.*

At the same time, I continued reading my Bible, and I noticed something remarkable: it was becoming clearer to me. Things that had once been confusing or mysterious were beginning to make sense. Truly, the holy Fathers are right in saying that the *Philokalia* is the key to understanding the hidden depths of Holy Scripture. With its help, I began to grasp the deeper meanings behind phrases like *“the hidden inner man of the heart,” “true prayer,” “worshiping in the spirit,” “the Kingdom of Heaven is within you,” “the intercession of the Spirit with groanings too deep for words,” “abide in Me,” “give Me your heart,” “put on Christ,” “the betrothal of the Spirit to our hearts,”* and the cry that rises up from within: *“Abba, Father!”*

As I prayed more deeply from the heart, the world around me began to feel transformed. The trees, the grasses, the birds, the very earth and air and light—they all seemed to proclaim the glory of God. Everything testified to God’s love for mankind. All creation, it seemed, was praying to God, singing His praise with one voice. And in that experience, I came to understand what the *Philokalia* calls *“knowledge of the language of all creation.”* I saw how a person, through prayer, can come into communion not only with God, but with all that He has made.

I journeyed on for quite some time, until at last I found myself in a place so wild and uninhabited that for three whole days I did not see a single village or soul. My supply of dried bread was gone, and I began to despair, fearing I might die of hunger. Yet each time that despair threatened to overwhelm me, I would begin to pray—and immediately the fear would fade. I surrendered myself fully to the will of God, and in that surrender was a deep joy and peace.

One day, as I walked along the road beside the forest, I suddenly saw a mongrel dog come running out toward me. When I called, it came eagerly and began to play affectionately at my feet. My heart leapt with joy! *Now this is surely a mercy from God,* I thought. *Surely there must be a flock grazing nearby, and this dog belongs to the shepherd—or perhaps there is a hunter close by.* Whatever the case, I hoped at least to beg some bread or find out where the nearest village was.

The dog danced and jumped about me, but when it realized I had nothing to offer, it suddenly darted back into the forest, down the narrow path it had come from. Curious, I followed. About five hundred yards in, I saw that the dog had slipped into a small hollow between some trees. It kept poking its head out and barking softly.

Just then, a thin, pale man of middle age appeared from behind a large tree. He asked me how I had come to be wandering there, and I returned the question, curious about his presence. We quickly fell into friendly conversation, and he invited me to his humble mud hut. He told me he was a forester, tasked with guarding this part of the woods, which had recently been sold for logging.

He offered me bread and salt, and we talked long into the day. I said to him, “I envy you, for you live in such comfortable solitude, far removed from the bustle of people. Meanwhile, I wander from place to place, always among strangers.”

“If you’d like to,” he said, “you’re welcome to live here too. There’s an old mud hut not far from mine—it used to belong to the watchman before me. It’s in poor shape, of course, but livable in the summer. You’ve got your passport, and there’ll be enough bread for both of us. Every week, they bring me bread from the village. There’s a spring nearby too—it’s never once dried up. I’ve lived here ten years now, brother, and in all that time, I’ve eaten only bread. I drink nothing but water. But just so you know: when the peasants finish working the land this fall, nearly two hundred of them will gather here to harvest the timber. When that happens, my watch will end—and you won’t be able to stay either.”

When I heard this, joy flooded my heart. I could hardly contain myself—how could I ever thank God enough for such unexpected mercy? What I had longed for—peace, solitude, and a place to immerse myself in prayer and the *Philokalia*—had been given to me, freely and without asking.

There were still more than four months before fall. That meant four full months to read, to pray, to learn the way to the unceasing prayer of the heart. So, without hesitation, I settled into the humble hut he showed me. It wasn’t much—but it was quiet, and it was mine, for a season.

I spoke more with the simple brother who had welcomed me, and he shared the story of his life with frank honesty.

“I had a good trade back in my village,” he told me. “I dyed fustian and linen—and I made a fine living at it. But I can’t say I lived without sin. I used to cheat my customers. I lied under oath, cursed often, drank too much, and got into fights. There was an old deacon who used to visit the Orthodox homes in our village. He had a very old book about the Last Judgment. For a few kopecks, he’d sit and read from it deep into the night. And I’d listen while I worked—he’d read about the end of days, the torment of hell, how the living would be changed and the dead raised, how God would come in glory to judge all mankind. He spoke of angels sounding trumpets, fire and brimstone, the worm that never dies.

“One night, I was listening, and suddenly, fear gripped me. I thought, *‘There’s no way I’ll escape that torment. I’m lost unless I change. Maybe there’s still time to save my soul. Maybe I can pray my sins away.’* The thought wouldn’t leave me. So, after much wrestling, I sold my house and gave up my trade. I had no family holding me back, so I took this job as a forest watchman, in exchange for a little bread, some warm clothes, and a few candles for prayer. The village *mir* agreed to take care of me, and here I’ve been ever since.”

“So I’ve lived here more than ten years,” he continued. “I eat only once a day—just bread and water. At the rooster’s first crow, I rise and begin my prayers. I make my prostrations until dawn, burning seven candles before the icons. During the day, as I walk my rounds through the forest, I wear iron chains under my clothes—seventy-two pounds of them—pressed against my skin. I don’t curse anymore. I don’t drink wine or beer. I don’t brawl. And I’ve never been with a woman—not once in my life.

“At first, I loved this life. I thought, *this is how I’ll be saved.* But lately... these thoughts won’t leave me alone. They sneak in and pull at me all the time. I start wondering: *Can sins really be washed away just by prayer?* And it’s a hard life, brother. I start to doubt if it’s all true—what that book said. *Will the dead really rise again?*

“Take someone who died a hundred years ago. There’s not even dust left of him—how can he come back? And tell me this—has anyone ever actually come back from the dead to tell us what’s next? Maybe the clergy made it all up—maybe those books were written just to scare us poor fools into behaving. Life is hard enough already. And if there’s nothing after death, if this is all there is, then what’s the point of suffering so much now?

“Wouldn’t it be better,” he said, his voice low, “to just go back to my old job, make a good living, and enjoy what’s left of my life?”

As I listened to him, my heart was moved with sympathy. I thought to myself, *People say it’s only the educated who become skeptics, who stop believing in God. But here is one of our own—a simple, kind-hearted peasant—and even he is tormented by doubt!* Truly, the powers of darkness are no respecters of persons; they prey on the learned and the humble alike. And perhaps it’s the simple ones they attack more easily. That’s why we all must seek wisdom and anchor ourselves in the Word of God—so we can stand firm when temptation strikes.

Wanting to encourage and strengthen this brother’s wavering faith, I reached into my knapsack and pulled out my beloved *Philokalia*. I turned to chapter 109, to the words of the venerable Hesychios, and read them aloud to him. Then I explained: “Brother, just giving up sin because you’re afraid of punishment isn’t enough. It doesn’t go deep enough to change the heart. The soul isn’t freed from dark and wandering thoughts by fear alone. It is only freed when the mind is guarded and the heart is purified—and that comes through interior prayer.”

I continued, “The holy Fathers are clear: if someone strives for salvation only because they fear hell—or even because they want heaven—they’re like a hired servant. Their motives are shallow. But God doesn’t want servants or hired hands. He wants sons and daughters who come to Him in love. He wants us to be honest with Him, to open our hearts and find joy in simply being with Him—not for a reward, but because we delight in His presence.”

“No matter how hard you work, how strictly you fast or how many prostrations you do, if you don’t keep God in your thoughts and His name in your heart, you won’t find peace. Your thoughts will trouble you, and you’ll fall into temptation—even small ones—again and again.”

“Why don’t you begin the Jesus Prayer?” I asked him gently. “You’re already in solitude—your life is perfect for it. Just try. It’s so simple, and soon you’ll see its power for yourself. Those tormenting doubts will vanish. You’ll start to feel faith and love for Jesus rising in your heart. You’ll begin to *know*—not just believe, but know—that the dead will rise again, and that the Last Judgment is real. Your heart will grow light, joyful, and full of peace. You’ll no longer feel alone, and you’ll no longer question the path you’re walking toward salvation.”

Then I showed him, step by step, how to begin praying the Jesus Prayer—and how to continue it without ceasing, just as the Scriptures and the holy Fathers teach us. It seemed that he was open to trying it; his heart had calmed, and a new peace had come over him. After this, I gently took my leave and went to the little mud hut he had told me about.

Oh, my God! The moment I stepped into that humble dwelling—more like a cave, or even a tomb—I was flooded with a joy beyond words. To me, it felt like the most glorious palace, filled with light, comfort, and the presence of God. Tears of gratitude flowed freely. I fell to my knees and gave thanks to the Lord for such mercy. “Here at last,” I thought, “in this stillness and solitude, I can return to the task at hand: to seek the prayer of the heart, and to ask the Lord to guide me in His way.”

And so I began again, reading the *Philokalia* slowly and carefully, this time from beginning to end. I did not rush. As I read, I was struck anew by the wisdom, holiness, and depth within those sacred pages. Each word carried weight; each teaching sparkled with light. And yet, because it covered so many themes and presented so many voices from the Fathers, I couldn’t fully grasp everything. Much of it I understood in part, but I longed to piece it all together, especially the teachings about interior prayer—about how to enter into the self-acting prayer of the heart, where the Spirit prays within us without ceasing.

This desire burned within me—not from pride, but from a longing to obey God’s own command through the Apostle: *“Earnestly desire the higher gifts”* (1 Corinthians 12:31), and again, *“Do not quench the Spirit”* (1 Thessalonians 5:19).

I pondered the matter deeply. What could I do? I decided I would press in—begging the Lord in prayer, not just once or twice, but continually. Surely, I thought, if I knocked long enough, the Lord would open the door and grant me light. So I resolved to do nothing else but pray, without pause, for a full twenty-four hours. As I prayed, my thoughts grew quiet, and eventually, I drifted into sleep.

In my dream, I found myself once again in the humble cell of my departed starets. He sat before me, lovingly explaining the *Philokalia*. “This holy book,” he said, “is filled with the deep wisdom of God. It is a mystical treasure trove, a sacred vault of divine understanding—of the hidden ways and judgments of the Lord. But it is not easily opened to everyone, nor is it understood the same by every reader. Rather, it gives instruction according to the capacity of the one who reads it. To the wise, it offers deep and discerning guidance. To the simplehearted, it offers a simpler path. That is why you, in your simplicity, should not read it in the order the teachings appear, one section after another.

“Instead, begin here: First, read the teaching of Nicephorus the Solitary, which is found in the second part. Then, move on to the full writings of Saint Gregory of Sinai—but skip the brief chapters. After that, read Simeon the New Theologian, especially his teaching on the three forms of prayer and his *Discourse on Faith*. Finally, read the writings of Callistus and Ignatius. Within these texts you will find the complete instruction on the interior prayer of the heart—clear and accessible to those who earnestly seek.”

He continued, “And if, after that, you wish for even greater clarity, turn to the fourth part of the *Philokalia*, where you’ll find a concise summary on prayer methods by Callistus, the most holy Patriarch of Constantinople.”

In my dream, I looked down and saw the *Philokalia* in my hands. I started to search for these passages, but I could not locate them easily. The starets smiled gently, reached down, and picked up a piece of coal from the ground. With it, he made a small mark in the margin beside the correct passage. “Here it is,” he said. “Now you will remember.”

When I awoke, it was still early—just before dawn. I lay still for some time, carefully turning over in my mind every word, every gesture, every detail of the dream. I wanted to preserve the instruction and imprint it on my memory.

But as I lay there, a new thought crept in: *Was this really the soul of my beloved starets visiting me, or was it all a product of my own imagination—born from how often I think of him and meditate on the Philokalia?* God alone knows the answer.

Still pondering all this, I got up as the first light of morning broke through the trees. And then—what do you think happened? I looked over at the flat rock that served as a table in my little hut, and there lay the *Philokalia*, wide open to the very passage my starets had shown me in the dream. Even more astonishing, there were markings in the margin—made in charcoal—exactly as he had done in the dream. Beside the book, just as before, was the same small piece of coal. I stood frozen in awe.

This deeply shook me, for I remembered clearly that the night before I had carefully wrapped the book and placed it at the head of my bed. I was also certain there had been no marks anywhere near that passage. At last I was fully convinced—my beloved starets had truly come to me in spirit, that he was alive in the presence of God, and that his guidance had been real and full of grace.

With trembling gratitude, I opened the *Philokalia* and began reading according to the order my starets had revealed: first the teaching of Nicephorus the Solitary, then Saint Gregory of Sinai (excluding the brief chapters), then Simeon the New Theologian’s words on the three forms of prayer and his *Discourse on Faith*, and finally the writings of Callistus and Ignatius. I read them all with great care—once, and then a second time. And with each reading, a holy fire grew within me: a longing, a burning thirst to experience personally all that I had read.

The veil was lifted. I began to understand what interior prayer really was—how one could enter into it, what its fruits were, and how it filled the soul and heart with joy. I also learned how to discern whether the sweetness I felt was truly from God, or simply from natural causes—or worse, a deception of pride or illusion.

So I began to put the teachings into practice. I followed the instruction of Simeon the New Theologian and sought out the “place of the heart.” I would close my eyes and focus inwardly, turning my gaze toward the left side of my chest, where the heart beats. I listened attentively. At first, all I could sense was darkness. But little by little, the image of my heart began to form in my awareness. I could see it in my mind and hear its steady beating.

Then I began the Jesus Prayer from within, linking it to my breath, just as Saint Gregory of Sinai and Callistus and Ignatius had taught: concentrating my mind in my heart, I would inhale, saying within myself, *“Lord Jesus Christ,”* and then exhale, whispering in my soul, *“Have mercy on me.”*

At first, I could only maintain this for an hour or two. But as time passed, I practiced longer and longer—until I found I could carry the prayer within me almost the entire day. And whenever weariness or doubt crept in—or laziness tried to steal my focus—I would open the *Philokalia* and read again those sacred passages about the heart. Without fail, desire and devotion would return to me, fresh as morning dew.

About three weeks into my practice of the Jesus Prayer in solitude, something extraordinary began to unfold. I started to feel a tender soreness in my heart—not a pain, but a sacred ache, followed by a warmth so delightful it seemed to embrace my whole being. This warmth came with peace and a gentle joy, and it stirred within me such a deep longing to remain in prayer always. It became my greatest desire, my sweetest occupation, my whole life. Nothing else mattered. My heart was being awakened by love.

From that point on, I experienced a variety of inner movements—gifts, really—both in my heart and in my mind. Sometimes, a bubbling up of unspeakable joy would overtake me. My heart would grow so light, so free, and so full of consolation that I felt transfigured—as though I no longer lived in this world but in the presence of the Kingdom. At other times, my heart would burn with love—love for Jesus Christ, yes, but also for everything and everyone He had made. And sometimes, tears—sweet and cleansing—would well up and pour out of me, not from sorrow, but from gratitude. I, such a sinner, was being shown such mercy!

And then there were the moments when a light would come over my mind—suddenly, things I had never understood became clear, even radiant. My ignorance was replaced with insight. Even the Scriptures, which had once seemed closed, now opened like flowers in springtime. At times, the warmth I felt in my heart would spread to my whole body, and the nearness of God became tangible—I could sense Him surrounding me like light or a gentle breeze. Other times, the simple whisper of Jesus’ name would bring more joy than any earthly delight.

I came to see that this prayer—the prayer of the heart—bears fruit in three ways: through the spirit, through the feelings, and through revelation.

* In the spirit, it brings love, peace, rapture, purity of thought, and a continual remembrance of God.
* In the feelings, it brings warmth, joy, vitality, a sense of lightness and detachment—even from physical illness or offense.
* In revelation, it opens the mind to Scripture, gives insight into the mystery of all living things, frees the heart from worry, fills one with the sweetness of divine presence, and confirms the intimate nearness of God and His unfailing love.

For nearly five months, I remained in solitude, immersed in this inner prayer. Over time, it became so constant and effortless that my heart and mind took up the prayer on their own, even without my will. It continued whether I was awake or asleep, whether I was reading, speaking, or walking. Nothing could stop it. It was like a living stream flowing through me. I had become a dwelling place for the name of Jesus, and my soul overflowed with praise.

Eventually, the forest workers returned and the time came for me to leave my little hut. I thanked the forester, offered a prayer of blessing, and bent down to kiss the earth—grateful for this sacred place where God had met me and changed me. I lifted my knapsack onto my back—my treasured books inside—and set off once again.

I wandered far and wide after that, until I came at last to Irkutsk. But the prayer remained with me. It had taken root so deeply that it became my constant companion, my joy, my song, my breath. It never left me, no matter where I went or what I was doing.

Even when I worked, the prayer flowed effortlessly from my heart and gave energy to my hands. If I was listening to someone speak or reading something aloud, the prayer continued alongside it, as if there were two voices within me—one attending to the world, and one always speaking with God.

Ah, what a mystery the human being is! Truly, as the psalmist said: *“O Lord, how wondrous are Thy works! In wisdom hast Thou made them all”* \[Psalm 104:24].

As I continued my travels, I encountered many extraordinary experiences—blessings, trials, and mysteries too great to fully recount. Truly, God’s hand was with me every step. If I were to tell them all, even a whole day would not be enough! But one particular incident stands out as a sign of the Lord’s care and the power of prayer.

It was a winter evening, and dusk was settling quietly over the snow-covered forest. I was walking alone toward a village about a mile and a half away, hoping to find shelter there for the night. Suddenly, from out of the shadows, a wolf lunged at me. I had nothing in my hands but the old woolen *chotki*—the prayer rope of my dear starets. I had carried it with me always, as a sign of blessing and a tool for prayer.

Instinctively, I swung the *chotki* to drive the beast away—but to my amazement, the knotted rope flew from my hands and wrapped itself miraculously around the wolf’s neck! The creature turned and bolted, crashing into a thorny bush. In his struggle, his hind legs became snared, and the *chotki*, now caught on a branch, tightened around his throat. The more he thrashed, the more entangled he became.

I crossed myself with faith and drew closer—not out of bravery, but because I feared losing the *chotki*, which I cherished deeply. As I reached for it, the wolf broke free just at that moment, snapping the cord and vanishing into the woods.

I was left standing there—stunned, heart pounding—holding the torn prayer rope. And yet, I was safe, entirely unharmed. I lifted my hands in gratitude and prayed for the soul of my beloved starets, thanking God for His mercy.

Eventually, I reached the village and found a small inn where I hoped to spend the night. Inside the warm hut, two men sat at a table drinking tea. One was old and thin, the other middle-aged and round, and both were clearly men of a higher class than the average peasant. I inquired of the stable boy who they were, and he told me: the older man was a public schoolteacher, and the other was a county court clerk. “I’m taking them to a fair,” he said, “thirteen miles from here.”

After resting for a short while, I asked the peasant woman for a needle and some thread. Taking a seat near the candlelight, I began to carefully mend my torn *chotki*. As I worked, the county clerk glanced over and said with a grin, “Looks like your prostrations were so intense, you wore out your prayer rope!”

“It wasn’t my prayers that broke it,” I replied quietly. “It was a wolf.”

The clerk burst out laughing. “Well now, do wolves say the Jesus Prayer too?” he scoffed.

I gently told them the full story—how I had been attacked, how the *chotki* had wrapped around the beast’s neck, how the bush had entangled him, and how I’d retrieved the rope, torn but still precious to me.

Still chuckling, the clerk said dismissively, “Ah, you ‘holy ones’ are always full of miracles! But where’s the holiness in this? You probably just flung something at the animal and got lucky. Wolves get caught in brambles all the time. There’s so much happening in the world—it’s a stretch to think everything’s a miracle.”

The old schoolteacher, who had been listening quietly, now spoke with gentle authority. “Sir, don’t be so quick to dismiss things you don’t understand. You’re speaking from shallow logic, without grasping the deeper mystery. But I, for one, see both a rational and a spiritual truth in this pilgrim’s story.”

“Oh?” said the clerk, amused. “And what’s so scholarly about a wolf caught in a bush?”

The teacher continued, “Perhaps you didn’t study much beyond the school catechism, but do you remember from the Scriptures how, in the beginning, Adam lived in innocence and harmony with creation? The animals approached him without fear. He named each one, and they were subject to him. Why? Because he was pure. Sin had not yet fractured the bond between man and the natural world.”

He turned to us, his eyes thoughtful. “Now consider this: when a person becomes holy, they are being restored to that very state of grace—the purity of Adam before the Fall. And holiness isn’t just in the soul. It seeps into the body, even into the things a holy person touches. That starets—the elder whose *chotki* this was—was a man of such sanctity. The prayer rope he held every day became infused with the grace that lived in him. That is why, perhaps, even a wild animal could sense something sacred in it.

“You see,” he said, “animals don’t reason, but they do sense. Their sense of smell is incredibly keen—especially for what we might call spiritual vibrations. This is not mere fantasy. It is a mystery. A real mystery of the spiritual and physical world.”

The clerk, clearly unimpressed, rolled his eyes and muttered, “You educated folks always go on about power and wisdom! For me, a shot of vodka is power enough.” He laughed to himself, got up, and went to pour a drink.

The teacher calmly replied, “You’re free to your own views. But please—leave spiritual and scholarly matters to those who’ve studied them.”

I was moved by the teacher’s words—he had spoken with both humility and insight. So I came closer and said quietly, “Batyushka, if I may, I’d like to share more about my starets.”

He nodded with kindness, and I began to recount the dreams I’d had, how the starets had visited me in them, offering guidance and instruction. I told him about the passage in the *Philokalia*, how it had been marked in charcoal—just as I had seen in the dream—and how the markings had not been there the evening before. The teacher listened closely, giving me his full attention.

But the clerk, now sprawled on a bench nearby, muttered without turning around, “You people are always losing your minds with all that Bible reading. It’s no wonder! What ghost walks around at night scribbling in books? You probably dropped it in your sleep and it got smudged with soot. There’s your ‘miracle’ for you. Oh, you rascals—I’ve seen your type before.”

With that, he turned to face the wall and drifted off to sleep.

I turned to the teacher and said, “If you wish, I can show you the very book. You’ll see for yourself that these are precise markings—not just some smudges from soot.” Reaching into my knapsack, I took out the *Philokalia* and opened it for him. “I’m amazed by such wisdom,” I said, “for how could a bodiless soul pick up a piece of charcoal and write with it?”

The teacher studied the marks carefully and said, “That, too, is a spiritual mystery. When spirits appear to us in bodily form, they create a material body from the air and elements around them. After their work is done, they return those elements to the world. Just as air can be compressed and stretched, so a soul clothed in it can interact with material things—like picking up a piece of charcoal and writing.”

He glanced at the book and opened it to a passage by Saint Simeon the New Theologian. “Ah, this must be a theological work—I’ve never seen it before.”

I replied, “Batyushka, this book is almost entirely devoted to teachings on the interior prayer of the heart in the name of Jesus Christ. It contains detailed guidance from twenty-five holy Fathers.”

The teacher smiled and said, “I am familiar with interior prayer.” I bowed deeply and asked him to share what he knew.

He spoke gently: “The New Testament tells us that all creation is subject to ‘vanity, not of \[their] own will,’ and ‘groans inwardly, struggling and desiring to enter into the liberty of the sons of God’ \[Romans 8:20ff]. Interior prayer is this mystical inward groaning of creation itself—an innate yearning of the soul toward God. It is not something that must be learned, for it is planted within everyone and everything.”

“How can one attain it, discover it, and experience it deep in the heart?” I asked the teacher. “How can one recognize and embrace it with one’s will, so that it becomes active—bringing delight, enlightenment, and salvation?”

He paused thoughtfully. “I do not recall if any theological treatises explain this clearly,” he said.

“But here,” I said, pointing to the *Philokalia*, “it is all written down.”

The teacher took a pencil, quickly jotted down the book’s title, and said, “I simply must order this book from Tobolsk. I want to study it.”

We parted ways after that, and as I resumed my journey, I thanked God for the blessing of that conversation. Yet my heart also ached for the clerk, and I prayed that the Lord might somehow lead him to read the *Philokalia* even once, granting him the wisdom he needed for salvation.

In spring, I came to a village where I found lodging at the house of a priest. He was a kind man who lived alone, and during the three days I stayed, he observed me carefully. Then he said, “Stay here with me. I need a conscientious person to watch over the workers and sit in the chapel, accepting donations for the new stone church we’re building near the old wooden chapel. You could do this, and it would suit your way of life. You could sit alone in the chapel and pray to God. There is even a small booth for the watchman. Please stay, at least until the church is finished.”

Though I initially tried to decline, the priest was insistent, and finally I agreed.

---

Through the summer, I lived in that chapel. It was peaceful and well suited to reciting my prayer, even though many people came by, especially on feast days. Some visitors came to pray, others to linger idly, and a few even to steal from the collection plate. I regularly read the Bible and the *Philokalia*, and when visitors saw this, some would strike up conversations with me. Others simply asked me to read to them.

After some time, I noticed a young peasant girl who often came to the chapel and spent long hours praying. I listened closely to her murmurs and realized that some of the prayers she repeated sounded strange—some were distorted, unfamiliar. Curious, I asked her, “Who taught you these prayers?”

She answered that her mother, a devout churchwoman, had taught her. But her father was a schismatic, belonging to a sect that rejected the priesthood altogether.

I felt compassion for her situation and gently advised her to pray according to the true tradition of the holy church—especially the Lord’s Prayer and the “Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos.”\* Then I said, “Why don’t you start saying the Jesus Prayer? It is a direct reach toward God, and through it, you can find salvation for your soul.”

The girl took my counsel to heart and began to practice what I had taught her with simple faith. And do you know what happened? After a short while, she told me she had grown so accustomed to the Jesus Prayer that she felt drawn to recite it continually—if such a thing were possible. When she prayed, joy filled her; when she stopped, a yearning to pray again welled up inside her.

I was deeply glad to hear this and encouraged her to keep praying in the name of Jesus Christ.

---

As summer waned, many more visitors came to the chapel—not only to hear me read and seek advice but also to bring their troubles and ask for help finding lost items. Some clearly thought I was a kind of fortune-teller.

Then, that same young girl returned one day, heavy with grief and desperate for guidance.

“What should I do?” she asked. “My father has decided to marry me off—against my will—to one of the schismatics in his sect. The wedding is to be performed by one of the peasants. How can that be a legal marriage? It will only lead to debauchery! I want to run away—it doesn’t matter where!”

“Where would you run to?” I asked gently. “They’ll only find you again. These days, there is nowhere to hide well enough. No matter where you go, they will track you down. Why not pray to God more earnestly instead? Trust in His judgment to soften your father’s heart and to save your soul from sin and heresy. That would be far wiser than fleeing.”

As time passed, life at the chapel grew unbearably noisy and full of distracting temptations for me. When summer ended, I decided it was time to leave and continue my journey alone.

I approached the priest and said, “Batyushka, you know what I seek. I need quiet and solitude to pray, but here there are too many harmful distractions. I have fulfilled my obedience by staying through the summer. Now please release me and give me your blessing for my solitary journey.”

The priest was reluctant to let me go and tried to persuade me to stay.

“What is stopping you from praying right here?” he asked. “There’s nothing you must do except sit in the chapel. Your daily bread is provided. Pray there day and night if you wish and live with God, brother! You have great gifts, and your presence benefits us. You don’t idle in gossip with visitors, and by faithfully receiving the collections, you do something truly profitable for God’s church. This is more pleasing to God than prayers in solitude.

“What do you need solitude for? It is merrier to pray in community. God did not create man simply to know himself, but so that people could help and guide one another toward salvation, each according to their ability.

“Look at the saints and the ecumenical Fathers! They cared deeply for the Church day and night and traveled widely to preach. They did not withdraw in solitude, hiding from others.”

“God gives each man his own gift, Batyushka. There have always been many preachers, but also many hermits. Each found their unique calling and followed it, trusting that God Himself was guiding them along the path to salvation. How else would you explain that so many saints relinquished their church offices, administrative roles, and priestly duties, fleeing into the solitude of the desert to escape the noise and distractions of life among people? Saint Isaac the Syrian left his episcopal diocese behind. The venerable Athanasius of Athos fled from his great monastery. They did this precisely because those places were too full of temptation and distraction, and because they truly believed the words of Jesus Christ: ‘For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?’ \[Matt. 16:26].”

“But they were saints!” the priest said.

“If saints needed to protect themselves from the dangers of mingling with people,” I replied softly, “then what must a poor sinner like me do?”

At last I took my leave of this kind priest, and he saw me off with genuine affection.

After walking nearly seven miles, I stopped for the night in a village. At the inn, I found a peasant who was gravely ill, and I advised his friends that he should receive his last communion. They agreed and sent for the village priest by morning. I stayed on, to venerate the holy gifts and pray during this great sacrament.

Meanwhile, I stepped outside and sat on a mound of earth to wait. Suddenly, a young girl came running toward me from a nearby backyard—the same girl who had spent so much time praying in the chapel.

“How did you come to be here?” I asked gently.

“The date was set for my betrothal to that schismatic,” she told me, “so I ran away.” Then she dropped to the ground before me and pleaded, “Be merciful—let me come with you. Take me to a women’s monastery! I don’t want to be married. I’ll live there and pray the Jesus Prayer. They’ll take me in if you speak on my behalf.”

“Mercy, child,” I said gently, “where could I possibly take you? I don’t know of any women’s monasteries in this part of the country. And even if I did, how could I travel with you when you don’t even have a passport? No one would take you in, and the authorities would find you in no time. They might even send you back with a charge of vagrancy.”

I looked at her kindly and continued, “Why don’t you go home and pray to God with all your heart? If you truly don’t want to be married, then pretend to be ill. It’s not deceit for the sake of sin, but for salvation. Even the holy Mother Clementa did this, and so did the blessed Marina when she took refuge in a men’s monastery. There have been many others like them.”

We were still sitting there talking when suddenly four peasants came thundering down the road in a wagon. Before I could say a word, they grabbed the girl, threw her into the cart, and drove off with her. The other three seized me, tied my hands together, and dragged me back to the village I had only just left. I tried to explain what had happened, but they shouted me down: “We’ll teach you to seduce our girls, little holy man!”

By the time we arrived, the sun was setting. They dragged me to the village courthouse, chained my legs, and locked me up in a jail cell to await trial in the morning.

That night, the kind priest who had hosted me came to visit. He brought some food and tried to comfort me. “Don’t worry,” he said. “As your spiritual father, I’ll testify on your behalf. I know your character. You’re not the kind of man who would do what they’re accusing you of.”

He stayed with me a while, then gave me his blessing and left.

Later that evening, the magistrate happened to be passing through the village. He stopped in to see the local deputy and was told what had happened. Without delay, he gathered everyone at the courthouse and ordered that I be brought in. We stood there waiting. The magistrate arrived in high spirits—still wearing his hat—and sat down heavily at the table.

“Hey, Epiphan!” he called out to the girl’s father. “Did your daughter steal anything from your house?”

“No, Batyushka, nothing at all,” he replied.

“Has she been caught in any funny business with that fool over there?” he asked, pointing toward me.

“No, Batyushka!”

“Well then,” the magistrate said, “here’s what we’re going to do: You handle your own daughter. As for this young know-it-all, we’ll give him a good scare tomorrow and throw him out of the village. And he’d best take the hint never to show his face here again. That’s that!”

With that swift judgment, the magistrate stood, stretched, and went off to bed. I was taken back to the jail. The next morning, two village policemen came, gave me a solid thrashing, and let me go.

I left the village praising and thanking God. It was such a joy to have been considered worthy to suffer even a little for the name of Christ. That thought warmed and strengthened my soul, and the unceasing prayer within me grew all the more vibrant.

None of it—neither the shame nor the pain—offended me. It all felt strangely distant, as though it had happened to someone else and I had only watched it from the side. Even the beating had been easy to bear. The sweet prayer that stirred in my heart overshadowed every hardship and kept my soul at peace.

After walking about three miles, I ran into the young girl’s mother. She was on her way back from the market, carrying a few purchases. When she saw me, she said, “Well, it turns out the bridegroom’s changed his mind. He’s angry that Akulka ran off. The marriage is off now.” Then she handed me some bread and a patty for the road.

I thanked her, and with a light heart and peaceful soul, I continued on my way.

The weather was dry that day, and I had no desire to seek shelter in another village. That evening, as I passed through the forest, I noticed two fenced-in haystacks and decided to settle down there for the night. I lay beneath them and soon fell asleep.

In my sleep, I had a dream. I was walking along a familiar road, reading from the writings of Saint Anthony the Great in the *Philokalia*. As I read, the dear starets appeared beside me. Gently, he interrupted and said, “You’re reading the wrong passage. Let me show you what you need right now.” He guided me to the thirty-fifth chapter of Saint John of Karpathos, and I read:

> “Sometimes the teacher submits to ignominy and suffers temptations for the sake of those who will benefit spiritually from this.”

Then he directed me further to the forty-first chapter, where I read:

> “Those who pray most earnestly are the ones who are assailed by the most terrible and fierce temptations.”

Looking at me with kindness and firmness, the starets said, “Be strong in spirit and do not despair! Remember the words of the Apostle: ‘He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world’ \[1 John 4:4]. Now you have seen for yourself that temptations come only to the extent a person can endure. And with the temptation, God also provides the way of escape \[1 Cor. 10:13].”

He paused, then continued: “It was this trust in God's help that strengthened the holy men of prayer. That hope stirred their hearts and set them aflame with love. They not only gave themselves wholly to unceasing prayer, but they also shared it with others—freely, lovingly—whenever God allowed it.

“Saint Gregory of Thessalonika once said: ‘We must not only heed God’s command to pray unceasingly in the name of Christ; we must also reveal and teach this prayer to others—monastics and laypeople, the wise and the simple, husbands and wives, even children. We must awaken the longing for unceasing prayer in all.’”

The starets then added, “Callistus Telicudes says something similar: ‘Interior prayer, spiritual illumination, and all gifts that lift the soul—none of these should be kept hidden. They should be written down and shared for the love and benefit of all.’”

He ended with a warning rooted in Scripture: “Still, guard your heart. Share the seed of God’s Word only with humility, never from vanity. Remember: ‘Brother helped by brother is like a strong fortress’ \[Prov. 18:19], but the Word of God must never be scattered to the wind.”

When I awoke from that dream, my heart was overflowing with joy. The words of the starets had strengthened me deeply, and I rose and continued my journey in peace.

---

A long time passed before another significant moment came. But I will share it with you now.

It was the 24th of March, and I felt a powerful, irresistible longing to receive Holy Communion the next day—the Feast of the Annunciation of the Most Pure Theotokos. I asked around for the nearest church and was told it was twenty miles away. Without hesitation, I walked the rest of that day and all through the night, determined to make it in time for matins.

The weather was harsh and unkind. First it snowed, then it rained. The wind blew hard, and the cold pierced through me. At one point I had to cross a small creek. As I stepped out onto the ice, it broke beneath me, and I plunged into the freezing water up to my waist. Yet I continued on, soaked and shivering.

I arrived just in time for matins and stood through the entire service, followed by the Divine Liturgy, where God, in His mercy, allowed me to receive the Holy Gifts. Though my body was weary and frozen, my soul rejoiced in His presence.

Wanting to preserve the peace and spiritual joy of the day, I asked the church watchman if I could rest in his room for the night. It was a simple, cold space—no heat, just a wooden plank for a bed—but it felt to me like the bosom of Abraham. As I lay there, prayer rose effortlessly in my heart, filling me with a quiet ecstasy. Waves of love for Jesus Christ and the Mother of God washed over me. I felt completely steeped in heavenly delight.

But toward evening, I began to feel a sharp pain in my legs and remembered that my clothes were still wet. I tried to ignore it, turning my attention back to the prayer in my heart. And as I prayed, the pain faded into the background, and I was lifted once more into joy.

The next morning, I tried to rise—but I could not move my legs.

They were completely paralyzed, lifeless as if they were made of string. The watchman, startled, helped drag me off the bed, but I could not stand. For two days I sat, unable to walk.

Then, on the third day, the watchman grew impatient and afraid. “If you die here, who’s going to bury you?” he snapped, and he began to chase me from the room.

With great effort, I dragged myself along the ground with my hands and collapsed on the stone steps of the church. I lay there for two full days. People came and went. They passed by without stopping, without even looking at me, as if I were invisible. I begged for help, but no one answered.

At last, someone came to me.

A peasant approached, sat down beside me, and began to speak with unexpected familiarity. “What’ll you give me if I cure you?” he asked. “I had the same thing happen to me once, and I know how to fix it.”

“I have nothing to give you,” I replied honestly.

“Well then, what’s in your knapsack?”

“Just a little dried bread and a few books.”

He thought for a moment. “How about this—if I help you get better, you come work for me for the summer?”

“But I can’t work,” I said. “I’ve no strength in my legs, only one arm is useful, and the other is nearly withered.”

He eyed me curiously. “So what can you do, then?”

“Nothing really,” I answered. “Except—I can read and write.”

“Aha!” he said, as if struck by inspiration. “You can write? That’s something! My boy knows how to read a little, but I want him to learn to write too. The trouble is, hiring a tutor costs twenty rubles—too much for me. How about this: you teach my son to write, and I’ll cure you.”

We shook hands on the agreement. With the help of the church watchman, he carried me to his house and placed me gently inside an old, abandoned bathhouse behind his yard. That would be my dwelling for the time being.

Then he got to work on the cure.

He scoured the area—fields, backyards, even the garbage heaps—collecting almost a bushel full of rotting bones: bird bones, cow bones, anything he could find. He washed them thoroughly, crushed them down with a heavy stone, and placed the powder into a large earthen pot. Turning the pot upside down, he set it over the mouth of a jar that was buried in the ground, sealing the edges of the lid with thick clay.

Then he built a large fire around it and kept it burning steadily for more than twenty-four hours.

As he tossed more wood onto the flames, he nodded and said confidently, “This will do it. We’re going to get tar from these bones.”

The following day, the peasant dug the jar out of the ground. Inside was a little more than a pint of thick liquid that had slowly dripped through the small hole in the upside-down earthen pot. It was reddish, oily, and gave off an unbearable odor—something like raw flesh. The bones, once black with rot and decay, were now pure and white, almost shimmering like mother-of-pearl or polished pearls.

I began rubbing this strange, foul-smelling liquid into my legs five times a day.

And what do you think happened?

By the second day, I could move my toes. On the third day, I was able to bend and stretch my knees. By the fifth day, I was walking around the yard with the help of a cane. Within a week, my legs had regained their strength entirely.

My heart overflowed with thanksgiving to God. I marveled at the wisdom built into His creation—that even dry, decomposing bones, forgotten and discarded, still held within them the power to restore life. Who could imagine that something so lifeless could contain such energy, such healing virtue? It struck me as a sign, a whisper from God Himself: *This too is a pledge of the resurrection to come.* How I wished the forester—my companion from a past summer, who had doubted the resurrection—could have witnessed this wonder!

Once I had recovered, I began to teach the peasant’s son as promised. I didn’t use a grammar book. Instead, I wrote out the Jesus Prayer for him by hand. I showed him how to form each letter, and his task was to copy it again and again. What peace there was in this! It was restful to my body and nourishing to my soul.

Since the boy spent most of his day apprenticed to the steward of a nearby estate, he could only study with me during a quiet window—from daybreak until the mid-morning Divine Liturgy, while the steward still slept. He was an intelligent child, and before long, he could write short passages quite well.

One day, the steward noticed the boy writing something and asked him, “Who’s teaching you that?”

“The pilgrim staying in our old bathhouse,” the boy replied. “The one with the withered arm.”

The estate steward, a curious man of Polish descent, eventually came to see me. He found me sitting quietly, reading the *Philokalia*. After a few pleasantries, he asked, “What are you reading there?”

I showed him the book.

“Ah, the *Philokalia*! I remember seeing this once at our *ksenda’s* house back in Vilna. I heard it contains some rather strange mystical teachings—some kind of magic or breathing tricks written by Greek monks. People say it’s similar to what those religious fanatics in India or Bukhara do—they breathe in strange ways to stir something in their chest, then they go on believing that these natural sensations are from God. It’s foolishness. We’re called to pray simply because it’s our duty. Say the *Our Father* in the morning as Christ taught—and that’s enough. None of this endless repetition! Say it over and over, and you’ll wear your heart out—or go mad in the process!”

“Please, Batyushka, don’t speak that way about this holy book,” I replied gently. “These weren’t just ordinary monks who wrote it. The *Philokalia* was compiled from the writings of the most revered and holy men—saints honored even in your Church. Saint Anthony the Great. Saint Macarius. Saint John Chrysostom. Mark the Anchorite. These weren’t misguided mystics—they were Fathers of the faith, filled with the Spirit of God.

“Yes, it’s true that others—like monks in India and Bukhara—adopted some of these practices, but my starets told me they distorted and misunderstood them. The teachings in the *Philokalia* are deeply rooted in the Word of God. The same Jesus Christ who taught us the *Our Father* also told us to ‘pray without ceasing’ and to love God with *all* our heart and *all* our mind \[Matt. 22:37]. He said, ‘Take heed, watch, and pray’ \[Mark 13:33], and ‘Abide in me, and I in you’ \[John 15:4].

“And the saints remind us that King David cried out, ‘O taste and see that the Lord is good!’ \[Psalm 34:8]. The Fathers explain that we are meant to *experience* the sweetness of prayer, not just recite it like a daily chore. We are to seek the joy and consolation that comes from truly dwelling in the presence of God.

“Let me read to you how these saints speak of those who reject this path of interior prayer. They warn that such people contradict the Scriptures, settle for a shallow spiritual life, and remain satisfied with mere outward good deeds. They don’t hunger and thirst for the deeper truth and, in doing so, they miss out on the joy and bliss of communion with God. Because they judge their lives only by what’s seen on the outside, they often fall into pride or delusion and lose sight of the inner life entirely.”

“The things you’re reading about are all very lofty,” the steward said thoughtfully, “but they don’t really apply to ordinary folks like us, living out our lives in the world.”

I smiled and replied, “Then let me read you something simpler—something that speaks directly to those living in the world who still managed to learn the practice of unceasing prayer.”

I opened the *Philokalia* and read aloud a passage from Saint Simeon the New Theologian, telling the story of George the Younger, a man who lived a regular life in the world but learned to pray without ceasing.

The steward was intrigued. “That’s impressive,” he said. “Let me borrow your book for a little while. I’d like to read more of it when I get the chance.”

“I could lend it to you for a day,” I said, “but no more. I read from it every day and depend on it for guidance.”

“Well then,” he said, “at least copy that story for me—I’ll pay you for your trouble.”

“There’s no need for money,” I answered. “I’ll copy it for you out of love, and I pray that God grants you a desire to take up the prayer yourself.”

I gladly wrote out the passage and gave it to him. He brought it home and read it to his wife. Both of them were deeply moved. Soon after, they began inviting me to their home more often. I would bring the *Philokalia* with me and read to them while they sat together over tea, listening quietly.

One evening, they asked me to stay for dinner. The steward’s wife, a warm and kindly older woman, joined us at the table. As we ate some fried fish, she suddenly began to choke on a bone. We tried everything we could to help, but the bone wouldn’t come out. She was in great pain, and after a while, she had to lie down in bed. We sent a messenger to fetch the doctor from the next town, nearly thirty miles away. But since night had fallen and there was nothing more I could do, I quietly returned to my little room.

That night I barely slept. In the silence of my light slumber, I heard the voice of my starets. I couldn’t see him, but I clearly recognized his gentle, firm tone.

“Your landlord once healed your body,” he said, “and yet you will not help the steward’s wife? Have you forgotten that God commands us to have compassion for the suffering of our neighbor?”

“I would gladly help!” I responded in my dream. “But I don’t know how!”

“Then listen,” he said. “The old woman has had a strong aversion to lamp oil her entire life. The smell alone makes her sick, and she cannot bear to swallow even a drop. But it is precisely this that will help her. If she swallows a spoonful of lamp oil, it will make her vomit. The fish bone will come out, and the oil will soothe the wound left in her throat, helping it heal.”

“But how can I get her to take it,” I asked, “if even the smell repulses her?”

“Tell the steward to hold her firmly. And you—pour the oil quickly into her mouth. Use force, if necessary.”

I awoke at once and hurried to the steward’s house. I told him everything just as I had heard it.

“Lamp oil?” he said doubtfully. “She’s already hoarse, feverish, even raving at times. Her throat is swelling badly. But then again, oil won’t harm her… and nothing else has worked. We may as well try.”

He poured some lamp oil into a small glass, and we went to her bedside. Gently but firmly, we managed to get her to swallow it.

Almost immediately, she began to vomit—and the fish bone came out, along with a bit of blood. Relief swept across her face, and soon she sank into a deep, peaceful sleep.

The next morning, I returned to check on the steward’s wife—and to my great joy, she was sitting up, calmly drinking tea. She and her husband were in awe—not only that she had recovered so quickly, but that her deep-seated aversion to lamp oil had somehow been revealed to me in a dream. No one else knew that about her.

Just then, the doctor arrived. The steward’s wife eagerly told him all that had happened, and I shared the story of how the peasant had healed me from paralysis with tar drawn from bones. The doctor listened patiently and said, “These things are not so unusual. Nature has its own powers. The same forces were at work in both your cases.” Then he took out a pencil and jotted some notes in his book, so he wouldn’t forget.

But after this event, something shifted in the neighborhood. Word began to spread that I was a visionary—some kind of healer or even a holy man. People came from all around with their ailments and questions. They brought gifts. They honored me and saw to all my needs.

For a week, I endured it.

And then I realized how dangerous it was. My heart began to tremble—not with joy, but with fear. The praise of others is a hidden snare. It creeps in sweetly but corrodes the soul. I saw how easily I might begin to think of myself as special, how easily vainglory might plant its seed and grow.

So I slipped away in the night without telling a soul.

And oh, what freedom! As I walked into the wilderness again, I felt as though some great weight had fallen from my shoulders. My heart felt light, unburdened, and open to heaven. The prayer returned in full sweetness, warming me from within. Often it would overflow—filling my heart with love for Jesus Christ until every part of my body seemed to pulse with joy.

Sometimes, when I reflected on the Scriptures, it was as if I saw them with my own eyes—living scenes unfolding before me. Such tenderness would well up in my heart that tears of joy would spill freely. How can I describe such joy? There are no words for it. Only the prayer itself can carry that kind of sweetness, and only Jesus can give it.

At times, I would travel for three whole days without seeing a single soul or any sign of human habitation. To my immense delight, this solitude made me feel as though I were the only man alive on earth—just one wretched sinner standing in the presence of the merciful and man-loving God. This precious loneliness was a balm for my spirit, allowing me to experience the delights of prayer with a sensitivity that was impossible amid the distractions of people.

At last, I arrived in Irkutsk. There I reverently venerated the relics of Saint Innocent, feeling humbled by the holiness that had passed through this place. But as I walked through the crowded streets, a question formed quietly in my heart: “Where do I go from here?”

The city, with its throng of people, was no place for the solitude I craved. Lost in thought, I met a local merchant who stopped me and asked kindly, “Are you a pilgrim? Why don’t you come to my house?”

I followed him to his lavish home, where he invited me to share my story. When I finished, he said, “Old Jerusalem is the true destination of your pilgrimage. The shrines and relics there surpass anything you have seen in this world.”

“I would love to go,” I replied, “but there is no land route. I could reach the sea, but I have no money to pay for passage by ship.”

The merchant smiled gently and said, “If you like, I can make it possible for you. Just last year, I sent one of our old men there.”

I fell at his feet in gratitude. “Listen,” he said, “I will give you a letter of introduction to my son. He lives in Odessa and trades with Constantinople. His ships sail there often. He will arrange passage for you on one of his vessels. Once in Constantinople, he will instruct his agents to book your passage to Jerusalem—and pay for it. It is not expensive.”

Overcome with joy, I showered my benefactor with thanks. I also gave thanks to God for His fatherly love and care for a wretched sinner like me, one who had been good for little, who had eaten the bread of others in idleness.

I stayed in the merchant’s house for three days, enjoying his generous hospitality and receiving the promised letter of introduction to his son.

And so I set out on my way to Odessa, filled with hope of reaching the holy city of Jerusalem. Yet I did not know if the Lord would grant me to venerate His life-giving tomb.
