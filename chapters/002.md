# Chapter 2

For a long time I wandered through many different places, always accompanied by the Jesus Prayer. No matter what I encountered—or who—I felt encouraged and comforted by the steady rhythm of that holy name in my heart and on my lips.

Eventually, I began to wonder if it might be better to settle down somewhere. I longed for enough time and solitude to study the *Philokalia* more deeply. I had read short passages here and there—whenever I stopped to rest at night or paused along the road during the day—but my heart ached to fully immerse myself in its pages. I hoped that, through the *Philokalia*, I might discover the way of salvation more clearly, guided by the prayer of the heart.

But as much as I wanted to find a place to stay, my circumstances made that difficult. I had a disability in my left arm that I’d had since early childhood, which made it hard to find any steady work. Without a way to support myself, I couldn’t manage a permanent home.

So I decided to head east, toward Siberia. I wanted to visit the grave of Saint Innocent of Irkutsk, and I imagined that the quiet of the Siberian forests and open steppes would be just the thing—less noise, fewer distractions, more space for prayer and study.

And so I set out once more, the Jesus Prayer quietly flowing from my lips with every step.

After a while, something beautiful began to happen. The prayer started to move from my lips into my heart. That is, while my heart beat in its natural rhythm, I sensed the words of the prayer echoing within it, gently and steadily: *Lord . . . Jesus . . . Christ . . .* — one word for each heartbeat.

So I stopped speaking the prayer aloud and instead listened, attentively and quietly, to the words of my heart. I remembered how my beloved starets had once told me how sweet this moment would be. And indeed, I began to feel a gentle tenderness deep in my chest—like a soft aching, but full of peace.

And then something even deeper stirred in me. My thoughts were filled with such love for Jesus Christ that it overwhelmed me. I imagined that if I were to see Him, I would fall at His feet and never let go—clinging to Him with tears and tenderness, kissing His feet in love and awe. I would thank Him from the depths of my soul for His mercy, for allowing even someone like me—unworthy and sinful—to taste such consolation through His holy name.

Then something wonderful happened. A gentle, wholesome warmth began to fill my heart, spreading gradually across my chest. It felt both comforting and holy, like being quietly embraced from the inside. This warmth stirred in me a desire to return to the *Philokalia*—not only to deepen my understanding of the prayer of the heart, but also to verify what I was now experiencing. I felt a cautious concern: what if I mistook this natural warmth for the grace-filled work of God? My late starets had warned me that such missteps—confusing spiritual progress with mere emotional experiences—could lead to pride and delusion. I wanted to be sure.

So I shifted my rhythm. I began walking mostly at night and spending my days seated under the shelter of the trees, reading the *Philokalia* with care and reverence. Oh, the wisdom it opened to me! So many things I’d never known, so many insights that felt like dew to my soul. The more I read and practiced, the more I tasted a sweetness I hadn’t even imagined before. The kind of sweetness that doesn't just touch the tongue—it fills the spirit.

It’s true that some of the teachings were still beyond me. My mind, dull and untrained as it was, couldn’t grasp everything at once. But the prayer itself—the living, breathing repetition of the name of Jesus—began to clarify what I couldn’t understand with reason alone. At times, in dreams, my dear starets would come to me and explain things gently, guiding me as if he had never left my side. Most of all, he would stir my heart toward humility.

For over two months that summer, I lived in this hidden bliss—walking the forests and backroads, praying as I went. When I reached a village, I would humbly ask for a bit of dry bread for my knapsack and a pinch of salt. I’d fill my little bark jar with water and continue walking—sometimes nearly seventy miles—sustained by little more than prayer and grace.

But perhaps, as I now reflect, there was still something lacking in me. Maybe it was due to the lingering sins of my broken soul, or maybe I still needed greater humility and guidance. For just as the season was coming to a close, I was met with a trial.

One evening, I had come out onto a main road as the sun was setting. Two men approached from behind. They looked like soldiers from their haircuts, and soon they fell in step beside me. Without much preamble, they began demanding money. I told them honestly, “I don’t have a penny.” But they didn’t believe me.

“You’re lying!” one of them barked. “Pilgrims always get plenty of money!”

The other sneered. “Enough talking.” Then, without warning, he struck me hard across the head with a club.

And with that, everything went black.

I don’t know how long I lay there unconscious, but when I finally came to, I found myself lying at the edge of a forest, just off the road. My clothes were in disarray, and my knapsack was gone. All that remained were the frayed ropes that had once held it on my back. But—thank God—they hadn’t taken my passport, which I’d tucked safely inside my old hat in case I ever needed to produce it quickly.

I slowly stood up and began to cry—not from the pain in my head, but from the anguish in my soul. My books were gone. My Bible and my *Philokalia*, which I had kept so close, had been stolen with the knapsack.

And so I wept. Day and night, I grieved deeply. Where was the Bible I had read since my early childhood, the one I had carried faithfully with me all this time? Where was the *Philokalia* that had offered such comfort and guidance, that had taught me how to pray? My heart broke under the weight of that loss. These books were my companions, my teachers, my very sustenance—and now they were gone. I hadn’t even finished learning from them. I thought to myself, *Why didn’t they just kill me instead of leaving me alive, empty-handed and starved of spiritual food?* What would I do now?

For two days I wandered, barely able to move, so overwhelmed was I by sorrow and loss. On the third day, utterly exhausted, I collapsed beneath a bush and fell into a heavy sleep.

In that sleep, I dreamed.

I saw myself back at the monastery, sitting once more in the cell of my dear starets. I was pouring out my grief to him, telling him everything. He looked at me with compassion and said gently, “Let this be a lesson to you in detachment from earthly possessions. It will help to loosen your grip on the world and ease your ascent toward heaven. This sorrow was permitted for your protection—to guard you from falling into spiritual gluttony.”

Then he added, “God asks the Christian for total surrender—a letting go of his own will, of his desires, of all attachments—so that he can become entirely available to the Divine. The Lord orders all things, even suffering, for the good and salvation of the soul. As it is written, “…who desires all men to be saved.”
—*1 Timothy 2:4*

“So take courage,” the starets said, “and believe that ‘with the temptation God will also provide the way of escape.’”
—*1 Corinthians 10:13*

“And you will soon be comforted in far greater measure than you now grieve.”

When I awoke from that dream, a deep calm had settled over me. My heart felt lighter, and a quiet strength stirred within my soul. I made the sign of the cross and whispered, “God’s will be done.” Then I stood up and resumed my journey. And as I walked, the prayer returned to my heart just as before—living, steady, and sweet.

For three days I traveled in peace, praying without ceasing.

Then, one day, I came upon a convoy of prisoners marching under guard. As I drew closer, to my amazement, I saw the very two men who had robbed me. They were walking at the edge of the group. I rushed up to them, threw myself at their feet, and begged them with all my heart to tell me what they had done with my books.

At first they acted as if I were invisible. But then one of them said, “We’ll tell you—for a price. Give us a ruble.”

“I swear to you,” I pleaded, “I’ll give you a ruble, even if I must beg for it in Christ’s name. Here—take my passport as a pledge if you like.”

At last they told me: my books had been taken and were now in the rear wagon, along with all the other stolen goods that had been confiscated from them.

“How can I get them back?” I asked.

“Speak to the captain,” they said.

I ran to the officer in charge and poured out my story—how I’d been robbed, and how my Bible and *Philokalia* were the only treasures I had in this life.

The captain listened thoughtfully, then asked, “Can you really read the Bible?”

“Not only can I read,” I answered, “but I can also write. You’ll see—my name is written in the Bible itself. And it matches the name in my passport.”

The captain nodded. “These two are deserters,” he said. “They’d been hiding out in a mud hut, robbing anyone they could find. They were caught just yesterday by a clever coachman who caught them trying to steal his three-horse team.”

He paused, then added, “Well, I suppose I’ll return your books to you, if they’re in the wagon. But you’ll need to walk with us to our next stop—it’s only a little over two miles ahead. We can’t delay the whole convoy just for your sake.”

I walked gladly beside the captain’s horse, and we struck up a conversation. He was older, with a kind and honest face, and I quickly saw that he was a good man. He asked about me—where I came from, where I was headed, and what kind of journey I was on. I answered every question truthfully, and before long we had arrived at the hut where the convoy would spend the night.

The captain went to the rear wagon, found my books, and returned them to me with a simple word: “Here they are.” Then he looked at the darkening sky and said, “Where will you go now, in the night? Stay here in the foyer.”

I could hardly contain my gratitude. Now that I had my Bible and my *Philokalia* again, I didn’t know how to thank God. I clutched them to my chest and held them so tightly that my arms went numb. Tears streamed down my face, and my heart beat with a tender joy.

The captain watched me quietly, then said, “It’s obvious that you love reading the Bible.”

I was so moved, I couldn’t speak. My tears flowed even more freely.

The captain continued, “Brother, I too read the Bible every day.” He unbuttoned his military coat and pulled out a small silver-bound Bible, printed in Kiev.

“Come, sit. I’ll tell you how I came to it.”

Then he called out, “How about some supper!”

We sat down together and he began his story.

“From the time I was a young man, I served in the army—not in some cushy garrison, but in active duty. I knew my job well and earned the rank of second lieutenant. My superiors liked me. But I was young, and so were my friends—and sadly, we all drank. At first it was just for fun, but soon I became completely dependent on alcohol. When I was sober, I was a model officer. But once I started drinking again, I was lost for weeks at a time, completely useless.

“They put up with it for a while. But one day, during a drunken outburst, I insulted a commanding officer. That was it. They demoted me to the rank of soldier and transferred me to a garrison post. I was warned: one more slip, and the consequences would be severe.

“I tried everything to stop drinking. I prayed, I fasted, I tried every cure I could find. But nothing worked. No matter what I did, I couldn’t overcome it. Eventually, they decided to put me under arrest.

“When I heard that…”
He paused, shaking his head.
“…I was at my wit’s end.”

“One day, as I sat in the barracks deep in thought, a monk came by, unexpectedly, collecting alms for the church. Each of us gave what we could. When he approached me, he paused and asked, ‘Why are you so sad?’

“We struck up a conversation, and I poured out all my woes to him. He listened with compassion and said, ‘The very same thing happened to my brother. Here’s what helped him: his spiritual father gave him a Bible and told him firmly that whenever he felt the urge to drink wine, he should immediately pick up the Bible and read a chapter. Every time the urge returned, he was to read yet another chapter. My brother followed this advice. And before long, the passion for alcohol left him completely. He hasn’t touched a drop in fifteen years. Why don’t you try the same? It’ll work—you’ll see. I have a Bible, and I’ll bring it to you.’

“I listened, but I replied, ‘How can your Bible help me when neither my efforts nor medical treatments have worked?’ I said this because I had never actually read the Bible.

“But the monk said, ‘Don’t say that. I assure you—it *will* help.’

“The next day, true to his word, he brought me his Bible. I opened it, looked through it, read a little, and said, ‘I won’t take it. I can’t understand a word. I’m not used to reading Church Slavonic.’

“But the monk insisted. ‘That doesn’t matter. These are the words of God Himself—they carry the power of grace. Just keep reading, even if you don’t understand everything. A saint once said, “If *you* don’t understand the words of God, *the evil spirits* do—and they tremble before them.” Your addiction to alcohol is surely the work of the devil. And here’s something else: Saint John Chrysostom wrote that even the *room* where a Bible is kept becomes a terror to the spirits of darkness. They can’t work their snares in a place where the Word of God dwells.’”

“I forget how much money I gave the monk, but I did accept his Bible. I tucked it away in a small trunk along with my other belongings—and then forgot about it.

“Some time later, I was once again overcome with a powerful urge to drink. The craving was so intense I felt as though I were dying for a taste of wine. I rushed to open my trunk, intending to grab some money and run to the tavern. But the first thing my eyes landed on was the Bible. In that moment, I remembered everything the monk had told me. I opened the book and began to read the first chapter of Matthew. I read the whole chapter, though I didn’t understand a word of it. Then I recalled the monk’s advice: *‘If you don’t understand it right away, keep on reading diligently.’*

“*All right,* I thought to myself, *I’ll read another chapter.* I did—and I began to understand. *Why not try a third chapter?* But just then, the barracks bell rang, signaling it was time for lights out. It was too late to go anywhere, so I stayed in.

“The next morning, I woke up still craving a drink. But then I thought, *What if I read a chapter from the Bible first?* I did—and stayed put. Later, when the urge returned, I read again—and felt better.

“This encouraged me so much that every time the desire to drink came upon me, I would turn to Scripture and read a chapter. The more I did this, the easier it became to resist. And when I had finally read through all four Gospels, the craving had left me completely. In fact, it had turned into an aversion. It has now been exactly twenty years since I last touched a drop of alcohol.”

Three years later, my officer’s rank was restored to me. In time, I was promoted again, until eventually I attained the rank of commanding officer. I married a kind and gentle woman, and we settled into a good life. *Thanks be to God,* we live peacefully, give to the poor when we can, and welcome pilgrims into our home. Why, even my son is an officer now—and a fine young man he is!

“Listen,” the captain continued, “from the moment I was freed from alcoholism, I made a vow: for the rest of my life, I would read the Bible—one Gospel every day, no matter how busy I was. And that is exactly what I’ve done. On days when I’m too exhausted to read it myself, I lie down and ask my wife or son to read an entire Gospel aloud to me, so I never miss a day. In thanksgiving to God—and to His glory—I had this Bible bound in pure silver. I carry it always in my breast pocket.”

I listened to the captain’s story with great delight and said, “I once knew someone with a very similar experience. In our village, there was a gifted craftsman who worked at the local factory. He was a good man and did beautiful, meticulous work—but sadly, he too struggled with drinking. A God-fearing man once suggested to him that whenever he felt the urge for wine, he should say the Jesus Prayer thirty-three times, in remembrance of the Holy Trinity and the thirty-three years of Jesus Christ’s earthly life. The craftsman took the advice to heart. He began saying the prayer—and not long after, he stopped drinking entirely. And that’s not all—three years later, he entered a monastery!”

The captain grew thoughtful. “Tell me,” he asked, “which is more exalted—the Jesus Prayer or the Bible?”

“It’s all the same,” I replied, “for the Divine Name of Jesus Christ contains within itself *all* the truths of the Bible. The holy Fathers say that the Jesus Prayer is the *abbreviated version of the entire Bible.*”

We said our evening prayers together, and the captain began reading aloud from the Gospel of Saint Mark, chapter one. I listened quietly, while in my heart I continued to pray the Jesus Prayer. At last, around two in the morning, he finished reading the Gospel, and we went to bed.

I rose early, as was my habit, and saw that everyone else was still asleep. As the first light of dawn crept over the land, I opened my beloved *Philokalia.* Oh, what joy welled up in my heart as I turned its pages! It felt as though I’d been reunited with someone I dearly loved—like a father or a friend returned to life. I kissed the book over and over and thanked God for giving it back to me. Then I turned to read the writings of Theophilus of Philadelphia in the second part of the *Philokalia.*

One sentence stood out to me with great force: *“While sitting in the refectory,” he writes, “give food to your body, give your attention to the reading of the day, and give your mind over to prayer.”* At first, this seemed impossible—to do three things at once. But then I remembered the joyful evening I had just shared with the captain, and I realized that what I had read was not only true—it was something I had already experienced. A mystery began to unfold before me: that the mind and the heart are not the same thing, but two distinct parts of the soul.

When the captain awoke, I thanked him sincerely for his kindness and prepared to continue on my way. He offered me some tea and gave me a ruble as a parting gift. We said our farewells, and I resumed my journey with joy in my heart.

I had walked no more than three-quarters of a mile when I remembered the promise I had made—to give those two soldiers a ruble if I ever got one. Now I had the means to keep that promise. But I hesitated. One thought argued, *“They beat you and robbed you! And they’re under arrest—they can’t even spend it.”* But another voice reminded me, *“If your enemy is hungry, feed him”* \[Rom. 12:20]. And again: *“Love your enemies”* \[Matt. 5:44]. Then I recalled the words of Jesus Himself: *“If anyone sues you and takes your coat, give him your cloak as well”* \[Matt. 5:40].

That settled it. I turned around and went back. The prisoners were just then being lined up for the next stage of their journey. I approached the two men and quietly placed the ruble into their hands. “Repent and pray,” I said. “Jesus Christ loves mankind—He will not abandon you.”

And with that, I turned and walked away, heading off in the opposite direction, my heart full and at peace.

After walking more than thirty-three miles along the main road, I felt a desire to turn off onto a quiet path where I could be alone and read. For a long time, I wandered through forests, encountering only the occasional small village. Often, I would spend an entire day in the stillness of the woods, sitting beneath the trees and carefully studying the *Philokalia.* I learned so many wondrous things from it. My heart was aflame with longing—a deep desire for union with God through interior prayer, a union I was now striving for under the guidance and confirmation of the *Philokalia.*

At the same time, I continued reading my Bible, and I noticed something remarkable: it was becoming clearer to me. Things that had once been confusing or mysterious were beginning to make sense. Truly, the holy Fathers are right in saying that the *Philokalia* is the key to understanding the hidden depths of Holy Scripture. With its help, I began to grasp the deeper meanings behind phrases like *“the hidden inner man of the heart,” “true prayer,” “worshiping in the spirit,” “the Kingdom of Heaven is within you,” “the intercession of the Spirit with groanings too deep for words,” “abide in Me,” “give Me your heart,” “put on Christ,” “the betrothal of the Spirit to our hearts,”* and the cry that rises up from within: *“Abba, Father!”*

As I prayed more deeply from the heart, the world around me began to feel transformed. The trees, the grasses, the birds, the very earth and air and light—they all seemed to proclaim the glory of God. Everything testified to God’s love for mankind. All creation, it seemed, was praying to God, singing His praise with one voice. And in that experience, I came to understand what the *Philokalia* calls *“knowledge of the language of all creation.”* I saw how a person, through prayer, can come into communion not only with God, but with all that He has made.

I journeyed on for quite some time, until at last I found myself in a place so wild and uninhabited that for three whole days I did not see a single village or soul. My supply of dried bread was gone, and I began to despair, fearing I might die of hunger. Yet each time that despair threatened to overwhelm me, I would begin to pray—and immediately the fear would fade. I surrendered myself fully to the will of God, and in that surrender was a deep joy and peace.

One day, as I walked along the road beside the forest, I suddenly saw a mongrel dog come running out toward me. When I called, it came eagerly and began to play affectionately at my feet. My heart leapt with joy! *Now this is surely a mercy from God,* I thought. *Surely there must be a flock grazing nearby, and this dog belongs to the shepherd—or perhaps there is a hunter close by.* Whatever the case, I hoped at least to beg some bread or find out where the nearest village was.

The dog danced and jumped about me, but when it realized I had nothing to offer, it suddenly darted back into the forest, down the narrow path it had come from. Curious, I followed. About five hundred yards in, I saw that the dog had slipped into a small hollow between some trees. It kept poking its head out and barking softly.

Just then, a thin, pale man of middle age appeared from behind a large tree. He asked me how I had come to be wandering there, and I returned the question, curious about his presence. We quickly fell into friendly conversation, and he invited me to his humble mud hut. He told me he was a forester, tasked with guarding this part of the woods, which had recently been sold for logging.

He offered me bread and salt, and we talked long into the day. I said to him, “I envy you, for you live in such comfortable solitude, far removed from the bustle of people. Meanwhile, I wander from place to place, always among strangers.”
