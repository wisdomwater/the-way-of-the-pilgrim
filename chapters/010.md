# A Summary of the Teachings of the Fathers

In conclusion, here is a brief summary of what the Fathers teach us about prayer, and the conditions for it to bear fruit:

Constancy: the steady, regular repetition of the Jesus Prayer.

Attention: keeping the mind fixed on Christ, gently but firmly resisting all other thoughts.

Variations in praying: saying the Jesus Prayer in its full form or in a shorter form, as the heart is able.

Sequences in a rule of prayer: alternating prayer with psalmody, sitting in quiet, standing with arms lifted, returning again to the Jesus Prayer, and reading from the Fathers after meals.

Walking in the presence of God: living in constant awareness of His nearness, keeping Him in mind whatever you may be doing.

Renunciation of the world: remembering death often, reflecting on the sweetness of prayer, and letting go of attachment to worldly concerns.

Unceasing invocation of the Name of Jesus: doing so always, whether aloud in solitude or silently in the heart when among others.

Falling asleep: ending the day with the Jesus Prayer on your lips and in your heart.

Formal prayers: asking God directly for the gift of inner prayer, entreating Him to grant sincerity and zeal so that the heart itself may be lifted into prayer.

Therefore, O soul, if you desire to taste the interior prayer of the heart, if you long for unbroken union and the sweet companionship of Jesus Christ—come forward. Make your resolve, and put into practice these teachings of the holy Fathers.

1. Sit down—or better yet, stand—in a quiet, dimly lit corner, placing yourself in a posture of prayer.
2. Begin with a few prostrations, steadying the movements of your arms and legs.
3. With your imagination, find the place of the heart beneath your left breast, and set your attention there.
4. Draw your mind down from your head into your heart, and begin to pray: *Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.* Say the words softly with your lips, or silently within, whichever is easier. Speak them slowly, with reverence and holy fear.
5. As you do this, guard your attention as best you can. Do not allow any thoughts to enter—whether they seem bad or good.
6. Be calm, patient, and determined to stay with this for a long time, setting aside all else.
7. Do not strain beyond your strength, but use moderation. Kneel as often as you are able.
8. Keep silence.
9. After your meal, read from the Gospels, and also from the Fathers who speak of the hidden life of the heart and of prayer.
10. Sleep no more than five or six hours each day.
11. From time to time, test the growth of your prayer by reciting the formal prayers of the Church.
12. Do not take up any work that scatters the mind or leads to distraction.
13. Continually measure your own experience against the instructions of the holy Fathers.

Long ago the Prophet David cried out: *Lord, strengthen my resolve.* So must you, O my soul, cry out as well: *Lord, grant me a steadfast will to keep watch! For both the desire and the strength to do it come from You. With Your help, may I cleanse my mind and heart through watchfulness, and prepare them as a dwelling place for You—the Triune God.*
