## The Teachings of the Holy Fathers on the Interior Prayer of the Heart

**A. First Category**

**(1) The Teaching of Saint Simeon the New Theologian**

Saint Simeon the New Theologian explains the way of entering the heart in what he calls his third method of prayer (Article 68, page 163, Russian translation, 2nd edition):

“The third method of prayer is truly splendid and difficult to explain. For those who have not experienced it, it is not only hard to understand but even seems impossible. In our time, very few practice this way of prayer, though it alone destroys the traps and snares that demons use to draw the mind toward countless thoughts. For only when the mind is free from all things can it, unhindered, examine the suggestions of the demons, resist them with ease, and offer its prayers to God with a pure heart.”

After naming the conditions for this prayer—perfect obedience and a clean conscience toward God, people, and all things—and urging us to act as if always standing before the face of God, he continues:

“By doing this, you will prepare a sure and reliable path to this third way of prayer, which is this: while the heart prays, the mind must guard it, and it must steadily keep its attention within, offering prayers to God from the depths of the heart.

*“Everything lies in this: work at it until you truly experience and taste communion with the Lord. When the mind is firmly established in the heart, when it tastes and knows with the heart how good the Lord is, it will not want to leave that place. Then the mind will say, as Saint Peter once said: ‘It is good for us to be here’ \[Matt. 17:4]. And it will always gaze into the heart, and always commune with it there, while driving away every thought sown by the enemy.”

“To those who do not understand this practice and who have no experience of it, it may seem difficult or burdensome. But those who have tasted its sweetness and felt its delight deep in their hearts cry out with Saint Paul: *‘Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?’* \[Rom. 8:35].

“For the Lord Himself has said, *‘Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies… These are the things which defile a man’* \[Matt. 15:19–20]. And again, *‘Cleanse the inside of the cup and the dish, that the outside of them may be clean also’* \[Matt. 23:26]. Because of this, our Holy Fathers set aside all other forms of spiritual activity and gave themselves wholly to this one thing: guarding the heart. They were convinced that through it they would quickly acquire every virtue, but without it they would not gain even one.

“They all practiced this above all else, and they wrote about it. Whoever wishes can read what Mark the Wrestler taught, or John of the Ladder, or Hesychius of Jerusalem, Philotheus of Sinai, Abba Isaiah, Barsanuphius the Great, and others.

“And if you wish to learn the way to do this—how to enter the heart and dwell there—I will tell you.

“Before all else, you must keep three things: freedom from every care—whether good, bad, or vain—so that you are, in a sense, dead to all things; a clear conscience in everything, so that it does not accuse you; and complete dispassion, so that your thoughts are not drawn to anything. Then sit alone in a quiet place and close the door. Turn your mind away from thoughts of all worldly and passing things. Bow your head, rest your chin on your chest, and direct your attention inward—not into your head, but into your heart. Fix both your inner gaze and even your outward eyes there, and regulate your breathing. With your mind in this place, try in every way to find the seat of the heart, so that once you discover it, your mind will remain there.

“At first, you will feel darkness and hardness inside. But if day and night you keep practicing this, you will gradually discover a hidden joy. By compelling the mind to persist in this exercise, it will find the place of the heart, and there, within, it will see things it had never before seen or known. From that moment, no matter where a thought arises or how it tries to appear—before it can enter or be entertained—the mind will instantly reject it and drive it out with the words of Jesus’ Name: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.’*

“Then the mind will even acquire a holy anger toward the demons, and it will begin to chase them away and defeat them. As for the other fruits of this practice, with God’s help, you will come to know them yourself, through keeping watch over your attention and clinging to Jesus through His prayer: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!’”*

**(2) The Teaching of Saint Gregory of Sinai**

Saint Gregory of Sinai gives his teaching on the interior prayer of the heart—and on how it becomes a steady and natural practice—in three of his writings on silence and prayer, found in the *Dobrotolyubiye* (part I, pages 112–119). What follows is a summary of his counsel.

Having received the Spirit of life in Jesus Christ, we are called to live like the cherubim—conversing with the Lord through the pure prayer of the heart. Yet we often fail to recognize the greatness and honor of this gift of rebirth. Neglecting our growth in the commandments, our minds never rise to true contemplation. Instead, we slip into negligence, give in to our passions, and sink into darkness and insensitivity.

We forget God, or remember Him only rarely. Though we believe, our faith remains inactive. Baptized into new life, we still live according to the flesh. Even when we repent, our obedience is shallow, not spiritual, and we drift so far from the true life of the Spirit that, when we see others living it, it can appear strange—or even like delusion. And so, many live out their days with a dead spirit, not in Christ, though *what is born of the Spirit must be spiritual*.

This gift, given at Baptism, is never destroyed—but it lies buried within us like a treasure hidden in the ground. Wisdom and gratitude call us to uncover it. How do we do this?

There are two ways:

1. By striving with great effort to keep the commandments. The more faithfully we keep them, the more brightly this hidden gift will shine.
2. By unceasingly invoking the Name of Jesus Christ, or by constant remembrance of God, which amounts to the same thing.

The first path is strong, but it finds its full power in the second. Therefore, if we truly desire to uncover the blessed seed planted in us, we must not delay in taking up this second way—this rule of the heart. By persisting in the unseen and formless prayer of the heart, it will begin to grow warm, until it bursts into flame with an inexpressible love for the Lord.

The activity of this prayer in the heart can happen in two ways. Sometimes the mind leads, clinging to the Lord in the heart through constant remembrance. Other times, the prayer itself stirs first, awakening with the flame of joy, and draws the mind down into the heart, holding it there before the Lord.

In the first case, the practice of prayer begins to show itself as the passions weaken—through keeping the commandments and through the warmth that grows in the heart by calling on the Lord Jesus. In the second case, it is the Spirit who draws the mind into the heart, uniting them in the depths and restraining the mind from its usual wandering.

In both forms, prayer works in two modes: sometimes active, sometimes contemplative. Active prayer fights, with God’s help, against the passions; contemplative prayer fixes its gaze on God, as much as is possible for us.

Active mental prayer of the heart is practiced in this way: Sit on a low stool, no higher than about seven inches. Draw your mind down from your head into your heart and hold it there. Then, with both mind and heart, call out: *Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!* Keep your breathing steady, not uncontrolled, so that your thoughts are not scattered. If you notice thoughts appearing, pay them no attention—whether they seem simple and good or vain and impure. By confining the mind in the heart and patiently repeating the Lord’s Name, you will overcome them. You will drive them away with the unseen power of Christ’s Name. As Saint John of the Ladder says: *“With the Name of Jesus flog your foes, for there is no surer weapon against them, in heaven or on earth.”*

If the mind becomes weary during this practice, and if the body and heart ache from the strain of uniting mind and heart in the constant invocation of the Lord Jesus, then stand and chant the psalms, or reflect on a passage of Scripture, or meditate on death. You might also read a little, or take up some manual work, or find another task to steady yourself.

When engaging in this work of prayer, it is best to read only books that deal with the inner life—sobriety and prayer. Read John of the Ladder, Isaac the Syrian, the ascetic writings of Maximus the Confessor, Simeon the New Theologian, Hesychius, Philotheus of Sinai, and other similar Fathers. For a time, set aside other writings—not because they are harmful, but because while you are pursuing this practice, they can distract your mind from prayer. Do not read excessively; rather, take in what you read carefully and make it your own.

Do not abandon prayer books entirely. Some keep many rules of prayer with strictness; others leave them behind altogether and turn only to the prayer of the mind. You should walk a middle path. Do not take on too many prayers, which will only scatter your attention, but do not neglect them altogether in times of weakness or illness. If you find that prayer has begun to work within you, flowing in the heart on its own, do not put it aside to take up the prayer book. That would be to leave God within, only to go outside and speak to Him from afar.

Those who have not yet received this gift of self-acting prayer should keep many prayers, even to the point of weariness, so that their hearts remain constantly immersed in prayer until, at last, the warmth of grace sparks the true prayer of the heart. The Fathers teach that when this gift of grace is received, one should reduce formal prayers and give more space to the prayer of the mind. And when the heart is weak, one can lean on prayers or on the writings of the Fathers. For just as oars are used when the wind fails, but laid aside when the sails are full, so written prayers are for when the Spirit seems quiet—but when the Spirit fills the heart, prayer itself carries you forward.

He who weeps with true contrition in prayer holds a mighty weapon against his enemies and against slipping from the joy of prayer into pride. Whoever guards this mingling of sorrow and joy will be kept safe from harm. Genuine interior prayer—free from delusion—radiates a gentle warmth born of the Jesus Prayer, a fire that burns in the soil of the heart and scorches away the passions like weeds. It fills the heart with peace and joy, not from left or right, nor even from above, but rising from within, like a spring flowing from the life-giving Spirit. Love this prayer above all else, guard it carefully within, and protect your mind from fantasies and daydreams. Fear nothing when this prayer is with you, for the One who said, *“Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid,”* is with us.

**(3) The Teaching of Nicephorus the Solitary**

Nicephorus the Solitary sets out his teaching on entering the heart in his *Discourse on Sobriety and the Guarding of the Heart* (Dobrotolyubiye, part II, pages 36–43):

“You who long to feel the divine fire in your heart and to experience the Kingdom of God within—draw near, and I will teach you the art of eternal life. It is an art that leads those who practice it, without toil or sweat, into the haven of dispassion. Through the Fall we went outside of ourselves; let us now return inward, turning our backs on what is outside. We cannot be reconciled with God or united with Him unless we first return to ourselves, coming back within from the life we live outwardly. The interior life is the only true Christian life. All the Fathers testify to this.”

A brother once asked Abba Agathon, “Which is more important, physical labor or guarding the heart?” The elder replied, “Man is like a tree. His physical labor is like the leaves, and guarding the heart is the fruit. And since Scripture says, *‘Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire’* \[Matt. 3:10], it is clear that the focus must be on the fruit—that is, guarding the heart. But we also need the covering of leaves—that is, physical labor.”

**From Saint John of the Ladder**
Saint John says, “Close the door of your cell to your body, the door of your lips to conversations, and the inner door of your soul to evil spirits. When you are in control—that is, when your attention is fixed on your heart—watch, if you are able, how many and what kind of thieves try to enter the vineyard of your heart to steal its clusters of grapes. When the guard grows tired—that is, when the one guarding the heart weakens—let him get up, pray, and then sit down again, returning with courage to the same task of guarding the heart and praying.”

**From Saint Macarius the Great**
Saint Macarius teaches, “The greatest work in all ascetic struggle is to enter into your heart, to hate Satan, and to wage war against him by rejecting his thoughts.”

**From Saint Isaac of Syria**
Saint Isaac writes, “Strive to enter the innermost secret place within yourself, and there you will see the treasures of heaven. The ladder to the Kingdom of God is hidden within you—that is, in your heart. So cleanse yourself of sin, gather yourself inward, and within your heart you will find the rungs by which you may ascend to what is above.”

**From Saint John of Karpathos**
Saint John of Karpathos says, “Great effort and perseverance in prayer are needed to achieve a clear and undisturbed state of mind—that other heaven within the heart where Christ dwells. For as the Apostle says, *‘Do you not know that the Spirit of God dwells in you?’* \[1 Cor. 3:16].”

**From Saint Simeon the New Theologian**
Saint Simeon the New Theologian writes, “From the time when man was banished from Paradise and cut himself off from God, the devil and his demons have been given the freedom, day and night, to stir up the thoughts of all people invisibly. There is no other way for the mind to guard itself against this than through the constant remembrance of God. Whoever keeps this remembrance engraved within himself is able to protect his thoughts from confusion.”

All the Holy Fathers affirm this.

**From Nicephorus the Solitary**
“Almost everyone who learns this greatest spiritual work does so by being taught by others. Rare are those who, because of their fervent faith, receive it directly from God without a human teacher. That is why it is important to seek an experienced guide. If you cannot find such a one, then turn to God with a contrite heart and tears. Ask Him to help you, and follow what I now tell you.

“You know that when we breathe through our lungs, the air passes through the heart. So, sit down, gather your mind, and guide it inward along the path of your breath. Force your mind to go down with the air you inhale, into your heart, and keep it there. Do not let it wander, as it wishes to. And while you hold it there, do not leave the heart empty—fill it with these words: *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me.* Let your mind repeat them without ceasing, day and night.

“Work hard to grow accustomed to dwelling in this inner place with this prayer, and guard your mind so that it does not leave too soon. At first, the mind will resist, as though it were imprisoned in this inner chamber. But once it grows used to remaining there, it will begin to delight in it. It will rejoice in staying there and will no longer want to leave. Just as a man who returns home from a far-off land is overwhelmed with joy to see his wife and children again, so too, when the mind finds its home in the heart, it is filled with indescribable joy and gladness.”

“If you succeed in entering the place of the heart by the method I have shown you, give thanks to God and keep practicing it; the exercise itself will teach you things you never imagined. But if, after much effort, you are unable to enter the heart by this method, then do what I now tell you, and with God’s help, you will find what you seek.

“You know that a man’s faculty of speech—the inner words with which we speak to ourselves—resides in the chest. It is there, when the lips are silent, that we carry on conversations with ourselves; there we silently recite prayers; there we chant psalms and speak inwardly. It is this inner faculty of speech that you must always use to repeat, *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me*, without allowing any other thoughts to intrude. You must compel yourself to use these words alone and nothing else. Persist patiently in this exercise, and soon, without fail, it will open for you the door into the heart, as we ourselves have found by experience.

“Together with this blessed and joyful entering into the heart—and guarding it with your attention—you will also receive the fullness of the virtues: love, joy, peace, patience, meekness, and the rest.”

**The Teaching of the Monks Ignatius of Xanthopoulos and Callistus**

Ignatius and Callistus, monks of Mount Athos, set forth their teaching on the inner activity of the heart in one hundred chapters (Dobrotolyubiye, part II, pp. 56–131). For our purposes, the following points are most important:

The beginning of life in God is zeal and careful diligence in living according to the commandments of Christ. The end is the perfection intended for us by divine grace in baptism—what Scripture calls *“putting off the old man with his former conduct and lusts and putting on the new man”* \[Eph. 4:22–24]. This is what Saint Paul meant when he said, *“My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you”* \[Gal. 4:19].

Saint John Chrysostom writes that when we are baptized, our soul, cleansed by the Holy Spirit, shines brighter than the sun. Just as polished silver gleams when struck by sunlight—not from its own nature, but from the light it reflects—so too, a soul washed in baptism shines with the rays of the Spirit’s glory and radiates beauty from within. But alas, this indescribable radiance remains with us only briefly. Soon, we extinguish it with the storms of worldly cares and passions.

We received this grace in fullness at the baptismal font, but if later we bury it under passions and distractions, we can uncover and renew it through repentance and the keeping of God’s commandments, so that its original splendor shines forth again. This renewal happens according to the measure of each person’s faith and zeal, but most powerfully by the blessing of Christ Himself. Saint Mark the Ascetic says: *“Christ, being perfect God, bestowed perfect grace of the Holy Spirit in baptism. It requires nothing from us then; yet its light is revealed in us according to how we keep the commandments, until we attain the full measure of the stature of Christ”* \[Eph. 4:13].

And so, since the beginning and root of salvation lie in living according to the Lord’s commandments, and the end and fruit of salvation are the restoration of the perfect grace of the Spirit—bestowed on us in Baptism, hidden within us, yet darkened by the passions, and revealed again by keeping the commandments—we must be zealous in keeping these commandments. Only then will we cleanse the gift of the Spirit within us and see it more clearly.

The Apostle John, who leaned on the Lord’s breast, tells us that the one who keeps the commandments of the Lord abides in Him, and He in them. And the Lord Himself says more plainly: *“He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him. . . . If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him”* \[John 14:21, 23].

It is impossible, however, to fulfill these life-giving commandments without Christ. As He Himself declares: *“Without Me, you can do nothing”* \[John 15:5]. And as Peter proclaims: *“Nor is there salvation in any other”* \[Acts 4:12]. Christ is for us the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

This is why the holy guides and teachers—those filled with the Spirit—so wisely urge us that before undertaking anything, we must first pray to the Lord, set aside all doubt, and ask for His mercy. We must keep His all-holy and sweetest Name always in our hearts, our minds, and upon our lips; and we must live with it unceasingly—in sleep and in wakefulness, in walking, eating, and drinking. For when we fail to invoke His Name, we become filled with evil and corruption. But when His Name abides in us, all evil is banished, every good thing flows abundantly, and nothing is impossible—just as the Lord Himself says: *“He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit”* \[John 15:5].

And so, after admitting our weakness and placing all our hope in the Lord—after cultivating such love for His commandments that we would rather give up our lives than break even one of them—we must focus all our energy on establishing within ourselves the unceasing invocation of the saving Name of Jesus. This Holy Name destroys all evil and brings forth all good. To aid us in this, the Fathers have handed down a practice, an art—indeed, the art of arts.

Here is the method of the wise Nicephorus, who teaches how to enter the heart in rhythm with the breath, a way that helps gather the scattered thoughts. His rule is this: Sit quietly in solitude. Gather your mind and draw it down into your heart along the path by which the breath enters as you inhale. Keep it there with the power of your attention, and with every breath repeat: *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me.* Continue until this invocation becomes one with the beating of your heart and flows without ceasing. This, the Fathers say, is the way to prayer of the heart.

Saint John Chrysostom exhorts us: *“I implore you, brothers, never abandon this prayer.”* Elsewhere he teaches: *“Whether eating or drinking, sitting or serving in church, traveling or doing anything at all, let everyone cry unceasingly: Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me! The Name of Jesus will descend into the depths of the heart, subdue the serpent within, save the soul, and fill it with life. Continue unceasingly in this invocation until your heart itself embraces the Lord, and the Lord embraces your heart, and the two are one.”*

And again he says: *“Do not let your heart drift away from God, but guard in it the remembrance of the Lord Jesus Christ, until His Name is rooted firmly within. Think of nothing else, but only that Christ is glorified in you.”*

Saint John of the Ladder says: *“May the remembrance of Jesus unite with your breathing.”* And Saint Hesychius writes: *“If you want to put to shame the thoughts that are foreign to you, and if you wish to guard your heart unceasingly, let the prayer to the Lord Jesus be joined with your breathing; and in just a few days, you will see your desire fulfilled.”*

Know this: when we train the mind to descend into the heart in rhythm with the breath, we may notice that once inside, the mind feels solitary, holding fast to only one thing—the remembrance of Christ Jesus. But when it wanders outside and scatters among external things, it becomes divided by many thoughts, ideas, and memories. To keep the mind whole and undistracted, the Fathers who practiced this art instruct those beginning this work to remain in a quiet, dimly lit place, especially in the early stages. For the eyes are doors through which thoughts scatter outward, and when outward sights are closed off, the mind more easily gathers itself within. As Saint Basil the Great says: *“A mind not fixed through the senses on the outside world returns into itself.”*

But remember: the true value of this practice lies not in breathing methods or in sitting in silence in a dim place, but in the single-minded, pure, undistracted calling of the heart upon the Lord Jesus Christ in faith. The Fathers only taught these outer techniques as tools, ways of helping the mind to collect itself and return inward from its usual distractions. Once the mind learns the habit of inward watchfulness, it gives birth to the habit of pure prayer—a prayer where the mind and the heart are joined in one.

Know, too, that all these bodily exercises are prescribed with care and are only needed until the grace of pure, undistracted prayer of the heart is granted. Once you receive this gift through the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ, you can set aside the many external methods and remain quietly united with Him in the simplicity of heart-prayer.

If you desire to live a life in Christ, strive to pray with your heart—purely and without distraction—at every time and in every place, during every activity. In this way, you will grow into maturity, becoming *“a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ”* \[Eph. 4:13]. And remember: if you are ever granted the gift of self-acting prayer, never interrupt it with your own planned rules of prayer. As Philemon teaches: *“If, by day or by night, the Lord grants you pure and undistracted prayer, then set aside your own rule and cling with all your strength to the Lord God; and He will illumine your heart in the spiritual life.”*

When the unceasing prayer of the heart is given, then—as Saint Isaac of Syria says—you have reached the height of all virtues and become the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Whether you sit, walk, eat, drink, or do anything at all—even in the depths of sleep—the fragrance of prayer will continue to flow effortlessly from your heart. Even in silence, it will go on unbroken, fulfilling its sacred work in the innermost secret place.

**B. Second Category**

**(1) The Teaching of Saint Hesychius (Priest) of Jerusalem**

(1) Attention is the steady silence of the heart, untouched by thoughts—a stillness where the heart breathes only the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and true God. In that silence, it calls upon Him, fights with Him against its enemies, and confesses its sins to the One who has the power to forgive (Text 5, *On Watchfulness and Holiness*).

(2) Watchfulness is the steadfast stance of the mind as a guard at the door of the heart. From there it observes the approach of hostile, foreign thoughts—those thieves and robbers. From there it listens to what these destroyers whisper; it sees the tricks they attempt and the images demons create to lure the mind into dwelling on them. If we apply ourselves diligently to this work, it will become a teacher, training us in the art of warfare against thoughts (Text 6).

(3) There are several forms of watchfulness: The first is to carefully examine every mental image or tempting suggestion. The second is to keep the heart deeply silent, still, and free of thoughts, while praying. The third is to continually and humbly call upon the Lord Jesus Christ for help. The fourth is to keep the soul mindful of death at all times. The fifth, the most effective of all, is to fix the gaze of the soul only on heaven and to treat everything of this world as nothing (Texts 14–18).

(4) The one who wages spiritual warfare at every moment must practice four things: humility, attention, refutation of thoughts, and prayer. Humility—because he battles arrogant demons, and so his heart must always lean on Christ’s help, for the Lord resists the proud. Attention—so that his heart remains clear of all thoughts, even those that seem good. Refutation of thoughts—so that the instant his sharp-sighted mind recognizes the intruder, he repels it at once, as it is written: *“So shall I have an answer for him who reproaches me…”* \[Ps. 119:42], and *“Truly my soul silently waits for God”* \[Ps. 62:1]. And prayer—so that, after resisting, he cries to Christ from deep within, with sighs beyond words. Then the struggler will see how the venerable Name of Jesus scatters the enemy and his illusions like dust in the wind, or makes them vanish like smoke (Text 20).

(5) The one whose prayer is still mingled with thoughts does not yet carry true weapons for the fight. The prayer that arms the soul is the one that works unceasingly in the secret place of the heart, scorching the enemy and his hidden assaults by calling on the Lord Jesus Christ (Text 21).

(6) You must watch inwardly with a sharp and steady mind to recognize the invading demons. The moment you see them, crush the head of the serpent with immediate refutation, and call on Christ with those same wordless cries. Then you will experience God’s unseen help (Text 22).

(7) If you humbly strive to keep your attention within your heart—reflecting on death, reproaching yourself, rejecting thoughts, and calling on Jesus Christ—and if, armed with these weapons, you daily walk the narrow yet sweet and joyful road of the mind, you will come to behold the Holy of Holies. Then you will be illumined in the knowledge of hidden mysteries through Christ, *“in Whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”* \[Col. 2:3]. For through Christ Jesus you will sense and know that the Holy Spirit has descended into your soul, enlightening your mind so that it beholds *“with unveiled face…the glory of the Lord”* \[2 Cor. 3:18] (Text 29).

(8) The devil, with his army, *“walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour”* \[1 Peter 5:8]. Therefore, we must never relax in guarding our hearts, in watchfulness, in rejecting thoughts, and in prayer to Jesus Christ our God. In all your life, you will find no greater help than from Jesus, for He alone, as Lord and God, knows the snares, the subtlety, and the deceit of the demons (Text 39).

(9) Just as salt seasons bread and other food and preserves meat from decay, so too the watchfulness of the mind preserves the spiritual joy of the intellect and the wondrous activity within the heart. In a divine way, it seasons and sweetens both soul and body, dispelling the stench of evil thoughts and keeping us always in goodness (Text 87).

(10) The more carefully you watch over your mind, the stronger will be your desire to pray to Jesus. But the more carelessly you watch over it, the more distant from Jesus you will become. As attentiveness brightly illumines the mind, so carelessness—falling away from watchfulness and from the sweet remembrance of Jesus—darkens it entirely (Text 90).

(11) The sweet and unceasing invocation of Jesus, joined with a warm desire and filled with joy, gently settles the heart in peace. It is Jesus Christ Himself—the Son of God, true God, and Source of all that is good—Who completely purifies the heart. For He says, *“I am God who makes peace”* \[Isa. 45:7] (Text 91).

(12) A divine state takes root within through the constant remembrance and invocation of the Lord Jesus Christ—if we do not neglect continual supplication and steadfast watchfulness, holding these as the only truly necessary works. Indeed, we have but one task above all: to call on Jesus Christ with a burning heart, begging to taste the blessings of His holy Name. For constancy is the mother of habit, both in virtue and in vice; and habit becomes second nature. Once the soul reaches such a state, the mind begins to hunt down its enemies on its own, just as a hound searches for a hare in the brush. But while the hound seeks to feed itself, the mind seeks to strike and to drive away (Text 97).

(13) The great spiritual teacher David said to the Lord, *“I shall preserve my strength through You”* \[Ps. 59:9]. So it is with us: we rely on the Lord’s help to preserve the strength of stillness in the heart and in the mind, from which all virtues spring. For He gave us the commandments, and when we call on Him constantly, He drives out from us that foul forgetfulness which, above all, corrupts the heart.
