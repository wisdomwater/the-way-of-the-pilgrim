## The Teachings of the Holy Fathers on the Interior Prayer of the Heart

**A. First Category**

**(1) The Teaching of Saint Simeon the New Theologian**

Saint Simeon the New Theologian explains the way of entering the heart in what he calls his third method of prayer (Article 68, page 163, Russian translation, 2nd edition):

“The third method of prayer is truly splendid and difficult to explain. For those who have not experienced it, it is not only hard to understand but even seems impossible. In our time, very few practice this way of prayer, though it alone destroys the traps and snares that demons use to draw the mind toward countless thoughts. For only when the mind is free from all things can it, unhindered, examine the suggestions of the demons, resist them with ease, and offer its prayers to God with a pure heart.”

After naming the conditions for this prayer—perfect obedience and a clean conscience toward God, people, and all things—and urging us to act as if always standing before the face of God, he continues:

“By doing this, you will prepare a sure and reliable path to this third way of prayer, which is this: while the heart prays, the mind must guard it, and it must steadily keep its attention within, offering prayers to God from the depths of the heart.

“Everything lies in this: work at it until you truly experience and taste communion with the Lord. When the mind is firmly established in the heart, when it tastes and knows with the heart how good the Lord is, it will not want to leave that place. Then the mind will say, as Saint Peter once said: ‘It is good for us to be here’ \[Matt. 17:4]. And it will always gaze into the heart, and always commune with it there, while driving away every thought sown by the enemy.”

“To those who do not understand this practice and who have no experience of it, it may seem difficult or burdensome. But those who have tasted its sweetness and felt its delight deep in their hearts cry out with Saint Paul: *‘Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?’* \[Rom. 8:35].

“For the Lord Himself has said, *‘Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies… These are the things which defile a man’* \[Matt. 15:19–20]. And again, *‘Cleanse the inside of the cup and the dish, that the outside of them may be clean also’* \[Matt. 23:26]. Because of this, our Holy Fathers set aside all other forms of spiritual activity and gave themselves wholly to this one thing: guarding the heart. They were convinced that through it they would quickly acquire every virtue, but without it they would not gain even one.

“They all practiced this above all else, and they wrote about it. Whoever wishes can read what Mark the Wrestler taught, or John of the Ladder, or Hesychius of Jerusalem, Philotheus of Sinai, Abba Isaiah, Barsanuphius the Great, and others.

“And if you wish to learn the way to do this—how to enter the heart and dwell there—I will tell you.

“Before all else, you must keep three things: freedom from every care—whether good, bad, or vain—so that you are, in a sense, dead to all things; a clear conscience in everything, so that it does not accuse you; and complete dispassion, so that your thoughts are not drawn to anything. Then sit alone in a quiet place and close the door. Turn your mind away from thoughts of all worldly and passing things. Bow your head, rest your chin on your chest, and direct your attention inward—not into your head, but into your heart. Fix both your inner gaze and even your outward eyes there, and regulate your breathing. With your mind in this place, try in every way to find the seat of the heart, so that once you discover it, your mind will remain there.

“At first, you will feel darkness and hardness inside. But if day and night you keep practicing this, you will gradually discover a hidden joy. By compelling the mind to persist in this exercise, it will find the place of the heart, and there, within, it will see things it had never before seen or known. From that moment, no matter where a thought arises or how it tries to appear—before it can enter or be entertained—the mind will instantly reject it and drive it out with the words of Jesus’ Name: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.’*

“Then the mind will even acquire a holy anger toward the demons, and it will begin to chase them away and defeat them. As for the other fruits of this practice, with God’s help, you will come to know them yourself, through keeping watch over your attention and clinging to Jesus through His prayer: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!’”*

**(2) The Teaching of Saint Gregory of Sinai**

Saint Gregory of Sinai gives his teaching on the interior prayer of the heart—and on how it becomes a steady and natural practice—in three of his writings on silence and prayer, found in the *Dobrotolyubiye* (part I, pages 112–119). What follows is a summary of his counsel.

Having received the Spirit of life in Jesus Christ, we are called to live like the cherubim—conversing with the Lord through the pure prayer of the heart. Yet we often fail to recognize the greatness and honor of this gift of rebirth. Neglecting our growth in the commandments, our minds never rise to true contemplation. Instead, we slip into negligence, give in to our passions, and sink into darkness and insensitivity.

We forget God, or remember Him only rarely. Though we believe, our faith remains inactive. Baptized into new life, we still live according to the flesh. Even when we repent, our obedience is shallow, not spiritual, and we drift so far from the true life of the Spirit that, when we see others living it, it can appear strange—or even like delusion. And so, many live out their days with a dead spirit, not in Christ, though *what is born of the Spirit must be spiritual*.

This gift, given at Baptism, is never destroyed—but it lies buried within us like a treasure hidden in the ground. Wisdom and gratitude call us to uncover it. How do we do this?

There are two ways:

1. By striving with great effort to keep the commandments. The more faithfully we keep them, the more brightly this hidden gift will shine.
2. By unceasingly invoking the Name of Jesus Christ, or by constant remembrance of God, which amounts to the same thing.

The first path is strong, but it finds its full power in the second. Therefore, if we truly desire to uncover the blessed seed planted in us, we must not delay in taking up this second way—this rule of the heart. By persisting in the unseen and formless prayer of the heart, it will begin to grow warm, until it bursts into flame with an inexpressible love for the Lord.

The activity of this prayer in the heart can happen in two ways. Sometimes the mind leads, clinging to the Lord in the heart through constant remembrance. Other times, the prayer itself stirs first, awakening with the flame of joy, and draws the mind down into the heart, holding it there before the Lord.

In the first case, the practice of prayer begins to show itself as the passions weaken—through keeping the commandments and through the warmth that grows in the heart by calling on the Lord Jesus. In the second case, it is the Spirit who draws the mind into the heart, uniting them in the depths and restraining the mind from its usual wandering.

In both forms, prayer works in two modes: sometimes active, sometimes contemplative. Active prayer fights, with God’s help, against the passions; contemplative prayer fixes its gaze on God, as much as is possible for us.

Active mental prayer of the heart is practiced in this way: Sit on a low stool, no higher than about seven inches. Draw your mind down from your head into your heart and hold it there. Then, with both mind and heart, call out: *Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!* Keep your breathing steady, not uncontrolled, so that your thoughts are not scattered. If you notice thoughts appearing, pay them no attention—whether they seem simple and good or vain and impure. By confining the mind in the heart and patiently repeating the Lord’s Name, you will overcome them. You will drive them away with the unseen power of Christ’s Name. As Saint John of the Ladder says: *“With the Name of Jesus flog your foes, for there is no surer weapon against them, in heaven or on earth.”*

If the mind becomes weary during this practice, and if the body and heart ache from the strain of uniting mind and heart in the constant invocation of the Lord Jesus, then stand and chant the psalms, or reflect on a passage of Scripture, or meditate on death. You might also read a little, or take up some manual work, or find another task to steady yourself.

When engaging in this work of prayer, it is best to read only books that deal with the inner life—sobriety and prayer. Read John of the Ladder, Isaac the Syrian, the ascetic writings of Maximus the Confessor, Simeon the New Theologian, Hesychius, Philotheus of Sinai, and other similar Fathers. For a time, set aside other writings—not because they are harmful, but because while you are pursuing this practice, they can distract your mind from prayer. Do not read excessively; rather, take in what you read carefully and make it your own.

Do not abandon prayer books entirely. Some keep many rules of prayer with strictness; others leave them behind altogether and turn only to the prayer of the mind. You should walk a middle path. Do not take on too many prayers, which will only scatter your attention, but do not neglect them altogether in times of weakness or illness. If you find that prayer has begun to work within you, flowing in the heart on its own, do not put it aside to take up the prayer book. That would be to leave God within, only to go outside and speak to Him from afar.

Those who have not yet received this gift of self-acting prayer should keep many prayers, even to the point of weariness, so that their hearts remain constantly immersed in prayer until, at last, the warmth of grace sparks the true prayer of the heart. The Fathers teach that when this gift of grace is received, one should reduce formal prayers and give more space to the prayer of the mind. And when the heart is weak, one can lean on prayers or on the writings of the Fathers. For just as oars are used when the wind fails, but laid aside when the sails are full, so written prayers are for when the Spirit seems quiet—but when the Spirit fills the heart, prayer itself carries you forward.

He who weeps with true contrition in prayer holds a mighty weapon against his enemies and against slipping from the joy of prayer into pride. Whoever guards this mingling of sorrow and joy will be kept safe from harm. Genuine interior prayer—free from delusion—radiates a gentle warmth born of the Jesus Prayer, a fire that burns in the soil of the heart and scorches away the passions like weeds. It fills the heart with peace and joy, not from left or right, nor even from above, but rising from within, like a spring flowing from the life-giving Spirit. Love this prayer above all else, guard it carefully within, and protect your mind from fantasies and daydreams. Fear nothing when this prayer is with you, for the One who said, *“Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid,”* is with us.

**(3) The Teaching of Nicephorus the Solitary**

Nicephorus the Solitary sets out his teaching on entering the heart in his *Discourse on Sobriety and the Guarding of the Heart* (Dobrotolyubiye, part II, pages 36–43):

“You who long to feel the divine fire in your heart and to experience the Kingdom of God within—draw near, and I will teach you the art of eternal life. It is an art that leads those who practice it, without toil or sweat, into the haven of dispassion. Through the Fall we went outside of ourselves; let us now return inward, turning our backs on what is outside. We cannot be reconciled with God or united with Him unless we first return to ourselves, coming back within from the life we live outwardly. The interior life is the only true Christian life. All the Fathers testify to this.”

A brother once asked Abba Agathon, “Which is more important, physical labor or guarding the heart?” The elder replied, “Man is like a tree. His physical labor is like the leaves, and guarding the heart is the fruit. And since Scripture says, *‘Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire’* \[Matt. 3:10], it is clear that the focus must be on the fruit—that is, guarding the heart. But we also need the covering of leaves—that is, physical labor.”

**From Saint John of the Ladder**
Saint John says, “Close the door of your cell to your body, the door of your lips to conversations, and the inner door of your soul to evil spirits. When you are in control—that is, when your attention is fixed on your heart—watch, if you are able, how many and what kind of thieves try to enter the vineyard of your heart to steal its clusters of grapes. When the guard grows tired—that is, when the one guarding the heart weakens—let him get up, pray, and then sit down again, returning with courage to the same task of guarding the heart and praying.”

**From Saint Macarius the Great**
Saint Macarius teaches, “The greatest work in all ascetic struggle is to enter into your heart, to hate Satan, and to wage war against him by rejecting his thoughts.”

**From Saint Isaac of Syria**
Saint Isaac writes, “Strive to enter the innermost secret place within yourself, and there you will see the treasures of heaven. The ladder to the Kingdom of God is hidden within you—that is, in your heart. So cleanse yourself of sin, gather yourself inward, and within your heart you will find the rungs by which you may ascend to what is above.”

**From Saint John of Karpathos**
Saint John of Karpathos says, “Great effort and perseverance in prayer are needed to achieve a clear and undisturbed state of mind—that other heaven within the heart where Christ dwells. For as the Apostle says, *‘Do you not know that the Spirit of God dwells in you?’* \[1 Cor. 3:16].”

**From Saint Simeon the New Theologian**
Saint Simeon the New Theologian writes, “From the time when man was banished from Paradise and cut himself off from God, the devil and his demons have been given the freedom, day and night, to stir up the thoughts of all people invisibly. There is no other way for the mind to guard itself against this than through the constant remembrance of God. Whoever keeps this remembrance engraved within himself is able to protect his thoughts from confusion.”

All the Holy Fathers affirm this.

**From Nicephorus the Solitary**
“Almost everyone who learns this greatest spiritual work does so by being taught by others. Rare are those who, because of their fervent faith, receive it directly from God without a human teacher. That is why it is important to seek an experienced guide. If you cannot find such a one, then turn to God with a contrite heart and tears. Ask Him to help you, and follow what I now tell you.

“You know that when we breathe through our lungs, the air passes through the heart. So, sit down, gather your mind, and guide it inward along the path of your breath. Force your mind to go down with the air you inhale, into your heart, and keep it there. Do not let it wander, as it wishes to. And while you hold it there, do not leave the heart empty—fill it with these words: *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me.* Let your mind repeat them without ceasing, day and night.

“Work hard to grow accustomed to dwelling in this inner place with this prayer, and guard your mind so that it does not leave too soon. At first, the mind will resist, as though it were imprisoned in this inner chamber. But once it grows used to remaining there, it will begin to delight in it. It will rejoice in staying there and will no longer want to leave. Just as a man who returns home from a far-off land is overwhelmed with joy to see his wife and children again, so too, when the mind finds its home in the heart, it is filled with indescribable joy and gladness.”

“If you succeed in entering the place of the heart by the method I have shown you, give thanks to God and keep practicing it; the exercise itself will teach you things you never imagined. But if, after much effort, you are unable to enter the heart by this method, then do what I now tell you, and with God’s help, you will find what you seek.

“You know that a man’s faculty of speech—the inner words with which we speak to ourselves—resides in the chest. It is there, when the lips are silent, that we carry on conversations with ourselves; there we silently recite prayers; there we chant psalms and speak inwardly. It is this inner faculty of speech that you must always use to repeat, *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me*, without allowing any other thoughts to intrude. You must compel yourself to use these words alone and nothing else. Persist patiently in this exercise, and soon, without fail, it will open for you the door into the heart, as we ourselves have found by experience.

“Together with this blessed and joyful entering into the heart—and guarding it with your attention—you will also receive the fullness of the virtues: love, joy, peace, patience, meekness, and the rest.”

**The Teaching of the Monks Ignatius of Xanthopoulos and Callistus**

Ignatius and Callistus, monks of Mount Athos, set forth their teaching on the inner activity of the heart in one hundred chapters (Dobrotolyubiye, part II, pp. 56–131). For our purposes, the following points are most important:

The beginning of life in God is zeal and careful diligence in living according to the commandments of Christ. The end is the perfection intended for us by divine grace in baptism—what Scripture calls *“putting off the old man with his former conduct and lusts and putting on the new man”* \[Eph. 4:22–24]. This is what Saint Paul meant when he said, *“My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you”* \[Gal. 4:19].

Saint John Chrysostom writes that when we are baptized, our soul, cleansed by the Holy Spirit, shines brighter than the sun. Just as polished silver gleams when struck by sunlight—not from its own nature, but from the light it reflects—so too, a soul washed in baptism shines with the rays of the Spirit’s glory and radiates beauty from within. But alas, this indescribable radiance remains with us only briefly. Soon, we extinguish it with the storms of worldly cares and passions.

We received this grace in fullness at the baptismal font, but if later we bury it under passions and distractions, we can uncover and renew it through repentance and the keeping of God’s commandments, so that its original splendor shines forth again. This renewal happens according to the measure of each person’s faith and zeal, but most powerfully by the blessing of Christ Himself. Saint Mark the Ascetic says: *“Christ, being perfect God, bestowed perfect grace of the Holy Spirit in baptism. It requires nothing from us then; yet its light is revealed in us according to how we keep the commandments, until we attain the full measure of the stature of Christ”* \[Eph. 4:13].

And so, since the beginning and root of salvation lie in living according to the Lord’s commandments, and the end and fruit of salvation are the restoration of the perfect grace of the Spirit—bestowed on us in Baptism, hidden within us, yet darkened by the passions, and revealed again by keeping the commandments—we must be zealous in keeping these commandments. Only then will we cleanse the gift of the Spirit within us and see it more clearly.

The Apostle John, who leaned on the Lord’s breast, tells us that the one who keeps the commandments of the Lord abides in Him, and He in them. And the Lord Himself says more plainly: *“He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him. . . . If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him”* \[John 14:21, 23].

It is impossible, however, to fulfill these life-giving commandments without Christ. As He Himself declares: *“Without Me, you can do nothing”* \[John 15:5]. And as Peter proclaims: *“Nor is there salvation in any other”* \[Acts 4:12]. Christ is for us the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

This is why the holy guides and teachers—those filled with the Spirit—so wisely urge us that before undertaking anything, we must first pray to the Lord, set aside all doubt, and ask for His mercy. We must keep His all-holy and sweetest Name always in our hearts, our minds, and upon our lips; and we must live with it unceasingly—in sleep and in wakefulness, in walking, eating, and drinking. For when we fail to invoke His Name, we become filled with evil and corruption. But when His Name abides in us, all evil is banished, every good thing flows abundantly, and nothing is impossible—just as the Lord Himself says: *“He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit”* \[John 15:5].

And so, after admitting our weakness and placing all our hope in the Lord—after cultivating such love for His commandments that we would rather give up our lives than break even one of them—we must focus all our energy on establishing within ourselves the unceasing invocation of the saving Name of Jesus. This Holy Name destroys all evil and brings forth all good. To aid us in this, the Fathers have handed down a practice, an art—indeed, the art of arts.

Here is the method of the wise Nicephorus, who teaches how to enter the heart in rhythm with the breath, a way that helps gather the scattered thoughts. His rule is this: Sit quietly in solitude. Gather your mind and draw it down into your heart along the path by which the breath enters as you inhale. Keep it there with the power of your attention, and with every breath repeat: *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me.* Continue until this invocation becomes one with the beating of your heart and flows without ceasing. This, the Fathers say, is the way to prayer of the heart.

Saint John Chrysostom exhorts us: *“I implore you, brothers, never abandon this prayer.”* Elsewhere he teaches: *“Whether eating or drinking, sitting or serving in church, traveling or doing anything at all, let everyone cry unceasingly: Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me! The Name of Jesus will descend into the depths of the heart, subdue the serpent within, save the soul, and fill it with life. Continue unceasingly in this invocation until your heart itself embraces the Lord, and the Lord embraces your heart, and the two are one.”*

And again he says: *“Do not let your heart drift away from God, but guard in it the remembrance of the Lord Jesus Christ, until His Name is rooted firmly within. Think of nothing else, but only that Christ is glorified in you.”*

Saint John of the Ladder says: *“May the remembrance of Jesus unite with your breathing.”* And Saint Hesychius writes: *“If you want to put to shame the thoughts that are foreign to you, and if you wish to guard your heart unceasingly, let the prayer to the Lord Jesus be joined with your breathing; and in just a few days, you will see your desire fulfilled.”*

Know this: when we train the mind to descend into the heart in rhythm with the breath, we may notice that once inside, the mind feels solitary, holding fast to only one thing—the remembrance of Christ Jesus. But when it wanders outside and scatters among external things, it becomes divided by many thoughts, ideas, and memories. To keep the mind whole and undistracted, the Fathers who practiced this art instruct those beginning this work to remain in a quiet, dimly lit place, especially in the early stages. For the eyes are doors through which thoughts scatter outward, and when outward sights are closed off, the mind more easily gathers itself within. As Saint Basil the Great says: *“A mind not fixed through the senses on the outside world returns into itself.”*

But remember: the true value of this practice lies not in breathing methods or in sitting in silence in a dim place, but in the single-minded, pure, undistracted calling of the heart upon the Lord Jesus Christ in faith. The Fathers only taught these outer techniques as tools, ways of helping the mind to collect itself and return inward from its usual distractions. Once the mind learns the habit of inward watchfulness, it gives birth to the habit of pure prayer—a prayer where the mind and the heart are joined in one.

Know, too, that all these bodily exercises are prescribed with care and are only needed until the grace of pure, undistracted prayer of the heart is granted. Once you receive this gift through the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ, you can set aside the many external methods and remain quietly united with Him in the simplicity of heart-prayer.

If you desire to live a life in Christ, strive to pray with your heart—purely and without distraction—at every time and in every place, during every activity. In this way, you will grow into maturity, becoming *“a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ”* \[Eph. 4:13]. And remember: if you are ever granted the gift of self-acting prayer, never interrupt it with your own planned rules of prayer. As Philemon teaches: *“If, by day or by night, the Lord grants you pure and undistracted prayer, then set aside your own rule and cling with all your strength to the Lord God; and He will illumine your heart in the spiritual life.”*

When the unceasing prayer of the heart is given, then—as Saint Isaac of Syria says—you have reached the height of all virtues and become the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Whether you sit, walk, eat, drink, or do anything at all—even in the depths of sleep—the fragrance of prayer will continue to flow effortlessly from your heart. Even in silence, it will go on unbroken, fulfilling its sacred work in the innermost secret place.

**B. Second Category**

**(1) The Teaching of Saint Hesychius (Priest) of Jerusalem**

(1) Attention is the steady silence of the heart, untouched by thoughts—a stillness where the heart breathes only the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and true God. In that silence, it calls upon Him, fights with Him against its enemies, and confesses its sins to the One who has the power to forgive (Text 5, *On Watchfulness and Holiness*).

(2) Watchfulness is the steadfast stance of the mind as a guard at the door of the heart. From there it observes the approach of hostile, foreign thoughts—those thieves and robbers. From there it listens to what these destroyers whisper; it sees the tricks they attempt and the images demons create to lure the mind into dwelling on them. If we apply ourselves diligently to this work, it will become a teacher, training us in the art of warfare against thoughts (Text 6).

(3) There are several forms of watchfulness: The first is to carefully examine every mental image or tempting suggestion. The second is to keep the heart deeply silent, still, and free of thoughts, while praying. The third is to continually and humbly call upon the Lord Jesus Christ for help. The fourth is to keep the soul mindful of death at all times. The fifth, the most effective of all, is to fix the gaze of the soul only on heaven and to treat everything of this world as nothing (Texts 14–18).

(4) The one who wages spiritual warfare at every moment must practice four things: humility, attention, refutation of thoughts, and prayer. Humility—because he battles arrogant demons, and so his heart must always lean on Christ’s help, for the Lord resists the proud. Attention—so that his heart remains clear of all thoughts, even those that seem good. Refutation of thoughts—so that the instant his sharp-sighted mind recognizes the intruder, he repels it at once, as it is written: *“So shall I have an answer for him who reproaches me…”* \[Ps. 119:42], and *“Truly my soul silently waits for God”* \[Ps. 62:1]. And prayer—so that, after resisting, he cries to Christ from deep within, with sighs beyond words. Then the struggler will see how the venerable Name of Jesus scatters the enemy and his illusions like dust in the wind, or makes them vanish like smoke (Text 20).

(5) The one whose prayer is still mingled with thoughts does not yet carry true weapons for the fight. The prayer that arms the soul is the one that works unceasingly in the secret place of the heart, scorching the enemy and his hidden assaults by calling on the Lord Jesus Christ (Text 21).

(6) You must watch inwardly with a sharp and steady mind to recognize the invading demons. The moment you see them, crush the head of the serpent with immediate refutation, and call on Christ with those same wordless cries. Then you will experience God’s unseen help (Text 22).

(7) If you humbly strive to keep your attention within your heart—reflecting on death, reproaching yourself, rejecting thoughts, and calling on Jesus Christ—and if, armed with these weapons, you daily walk the narrow yet sweet and joyful road of the mind, you will come to behold the Holy of Holies. Then you will be illumined in the knowledge of hidden mysteries through Christ, *“in Whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”* \[Col. 2:3]. For through Christ Jesus you will sense and know that the Holy Spirit has descended into your soul, enlightening your mind so that it beholds *“with unveiled face…the glory of the Lord”* \[2 Cor. 3:18] (Text 29).

(8) The devil, with his army, *“walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour”* \[1 Peter 5:8]. Therefore, we must never relax in guarding our hearts, in watchfulness, in rejecting thoughts, and in prayer to Jesus Christ our God. In all your life, you will find no greater help than from Jesus, for He alone, as Lord and God, knows the snares, the subtlety, and the deceit of the demons (Text 39).

(9) Just as salt seasons bread and other food and preserves meat from decay, so too the watchfulness of the mind preserves the spiritual joy of the intellect and the wondrous activity within the heart. In a divine way, it seasons and sweetens both soul and body, dispelling the stench of evil thoughts and keeping us always in goodness (Text 87).

(10) The more carefully you watch over your mind, the stronger will be your desire to pray to Jesus. But the more carelessly you watch over it, the more distant from Jesus you will become. As attentiveness brightly illumines the mind, so carelessness—falling away from watchfulness and from the sweet remembrance of Jesus—darkens it entirely (Text 90).

(11) The sweet and unceasing invocation of Jesus, joined with a warm desire and filled with joy, gently settles the heart in peace. It is Jesus Christ Himself—the Son of God, true God, and Source of all that is good—Who completely purifies the heart. For He says, *“I am God who makes peace”* \[Isa. 45:7] (Text 91).

(12) A divine state takes root within through the constant remembrance and invocation of the Lord Jesus Christ—if we do not neglect continual supplication and steadfast watchfulness, holding these as the only truly necessary works. Indeed, we have but one task above all: to call on Jesus Christ with a burning heart, begging to taste the blessings of His holy Name. For constancy is the mother of habit, both in virtue and in vice; and habit becomes second nature. Once the soul reaches such a state, the mind begins to hunt down its enemies on its own, just as a hound searches for a hare in the brush. But while the hound seeks to feed itself, the mind seeks to strike and to drive away (Text 97).

(13) The great spiritual teacher David said to the Lord, *“I shall preserve my strength through You”* \[Ps. 59:9]. So it is with us: we rely on the Lord’s help to preserve the strength of stillness in the heart and in the mind, from which all virtues spring. For He gave us the commandments, and when we call on Him constantly, He drives out from us that foul forgetfulness which, above all, corrupts the heart.

(14) When, though unworthy, we are allowed to receive with fear and awe the Communion of the Divine and Most Pure Mysteries of Christ our God and King, we must show the highest vigilance, sobriety of mind, and strict attention. In this way, the divine fire—the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ—will consume our sins and iniquities, both great and small. For when He enters into us, He immediately drives out the cunning spirits of evil from the heart and forgives us our past sins; and then our intellect is freed from the restless harassment of evil thoughts. If after this you continue to guard the door of your heart and carefully watch over your mind, you will be made worthy again to receive the Holy Mysteries, and the Divine Body will shine ever more brightly within you, making your intellect gleam like the stars (Text 101).

(15) Care must be taken to guard what is truly precious. And the only thing truly precious for us is that which protects us from all evil that enters through the senses and the mind. This is the guarding of the intellect while calling on Jesus Christ: the continual turning inward, keeping stillness in the heart, a constant silence of the mind—not broken even by thoughts that seem good—and striving to keep the mind free of all thoughts altogether, so that demons cannot slip in hidden behind them (Text 103).

(16) The Name of Jesus Christ must always be repeated in the heart, just as flashes of lightning return again and again in the sky before the rain. Those who have experience in inner spiritual battle know this well. This warfare must be carried out as in real combat. First comes watchfulness: then, when a hostile thought approaches, we strike at it with sharp rebuke from the heart. The third step is to direct prayer against it, fixing the heart on the invocation of Jesus Christ, so that the demonic presence is instantly scattered, and the mind is not carried away after it like a child being lured by a deceitful sorcerer (Text 105).

(17) This is the great gain that the intellect receives from stillness: all sins that first attack only as thoughts—which, if welcomed by the heart, would soon become gross sins of outward acts—are cut off within the inner man through the virtue of watchfulness. And with the help and intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ, this watchfulness does not allow such thoughts to enter or to become deeds (Text 111).

(18) As valleys bring forth abundant wheat, so too does the Jesus Prayer bring forth abundant blessings in the heart. Or rather, it is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself who grants them, for without Him we can do nothing. At first, prayer appears like a ladder, then like a book to be read, and finally—as one advances further and further—it appears as the heavenly Jerusalem itself, the city of the King of Hosts, who is with the Father—of one Essence with Him—and with the venerable Holy Spirit (Text 117).

(19) When the soul is released from the body at death and approaches the gates of heaven, it will not be put to shame by its enemies if Christ is with it. Rather, it will stand boldly against them, just as it does now. But the soul must not grow weary, day or night, of calling upon the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, until its appointed time comes to leave this life. Then He will swiftly come to its aid, both in this life and in the life to come, according to His true and divine promise in the parable of the unjust judge: “I tell you that He will avenge them speedily” \[Luke 18:8] (Text 149).

(20) If we strive to guard our mind and join sobriety with humility, refuting thoughts with prayer, then we walk the right spiritual road with the venerable and holy Name of Jesus Christ as our lantern. But if we rely only on our own vigilance and watchfulness, we will be struck down at the first assault of the enemy. Then these crafty deceivers will try to overpower us in every way, entangling us in their webs of evil desires, or else they will swiftly destroy us, since we lack the victorious sword of the Name of Jesus Christ. For only this glorious sword, ever watchful in a heart free of thoughts, has the power to strike and drive back the enemy, to scorch and consume him like fire devours dry straw (Text 152).

(21) The task of constant watchfulness, so beneficial and fruitful for the soul, is to notice the first stirrings of imaginary thoughts as they arise in the mind. The task of refuting thoughts is to unmask and cast out, in shame, any thought that tries to slip into the mind disguised as the image of some material thing. It is the invocation of the Lord that instantly extinguishes and scatters every scheme of the enemy—every word, every fantasy, every idol, every dark form. And with our own intellect we can see clearly how mightily they are conquered by Jesus, our great God, who defends us, the humble, the poor, the ones who are nothing without Him (Text 153).

(22) A ship cannot sail where there is no water; in the same way, guarding the mind cannot succeed without attention joined to humility and the unceasing Jesus Prayer (Text 168).

(23) The unceasing prayer of the mind clears away the storm clouds of evil spirits. When the heart is pure, nothing prevents the divine light of Jesus from shining within—unless we let self-esteem, doubt, or a grasping for the unreachable creep in. Such things drive away His help, for Christ abhors pride; He Himself is the perfect example of humility (Text 175).

(24) Just as words carved into stone endure, while those traced in the air vanish, so too must our vigilance be firmly joined with the Jesus Prayer, so that this splendid virtue of watchfulness remains steadfast in us, preserved forever by His Name (Text 183).

(25) When guarding the mind is done for God alone and becomes rooted in the soul, it grants the intellect a wisdom that guides all struggles and words according to God’s will. It equips the spiritual warrior to act with discernment that is flawless and sure (Text 194).

(26) Blessed is the one whose mind has become one with the Jesus Prayer, and whose heart cries out to Him unceasingly, as air fills the body and fire burns within a candle. Just as the rising sun lights the earth, so the holy and precious Name of the Lord Jesus, shining constantly within the soul, gives birth to boundless contemplations, radiant as the sun itself (Text 196).

(27) Just as dispersing clouds clear the air, so when Jesus Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, drives away the fantasies of passion, a light is born in the heart—brilliant as the sun and radiant as the stars—for Christ Himself has illumined it (Text 197).

**(2) The Teaching of Philotheus of Sinai**

(1) Whoever strives toward righteousness should fix in his heart the remembrance of God as his one true treasure, cherishing it like a pearl of great price or a precious jewel. He should set aside everything else—even disregard his own body and scorn this passing life—in order to possess only God within (Text 1).

(2) Each day must begin with courage: the mind must take its stand at the door of the heart, unwavering, keeping God’s remembrance and the prayer of Jesus alive within the soul. With such attentiveness, he slays “the sinners of this world”—that is, he cuts down the rising force of thoughts and resists their attacks with the firm remembrance of God (Text 2).

(3) Watchfulness is rightly called both a *way* and a *workplace of the mind*. It is a way because it leads into the kingdom—both the one within us now and the one to come. It is a workplace because it shapes the mind, fashions spiritual habits, and transforms passions into dispassion. It is like a narrow window through which God looks in and reveals Himself to the intellect (Text 3).

(4) The dwelling place of God—the heaven of the heart—is where humility abides, where the remembrance of God is kept with sobriety and watchfulness, and where constant prayer rises up against evil. The hosts of demons do not dare approach this place, for God Himself dwells there (Text 4).

(5) The first door into the Jerusalem of the mind, or watchfulness of the mind, is the wise silence of the lips, even if the mind itself has not yet found silence. The second door is temperance in eating, drinking, and sleeping. The third door, which purifies both mind and body, is the constant remembrance of and reflection on death (Text 6).

(6) The delightful remembrance of God—Jesus Christ—together with holy anger and righteous hatred against sin, usually destroys every temptation of thoughts, words, fantasies, and shameful images. In short, it destroys every weapon of the enemy who seeks to devour our souls. When His Name is invoked, Jesus Himself easily scatters them all, for there is no salvation apart from Him. The Savior said: “Without Me, you can do nothing” \[John 15:5] (Text 22).

(7) Therefore, each hour and at every moment, let us guard our hearts zealously against the thoughts that cloud the mirror of the soul, which should reflect only the holy image of Jesus Christ, the Wisdom and Power of God. Let us continually seek the Kingdom of Heaven within our hearts, and in the end, if we purify the eye of our intellect, we will mystically discover within ourselves the seed, the pearl, the leaven, and everything else. This is why the Lord Jesus Christ said: “The Kingdom of God is within you” \[Luke 17:21], speaking of the Divine Presence that dwells in our hearts (Text 23).

(8) Interior spiritual warfare should be conducted in this way: Combine prayer with watchfulness—let watchfulness strengthen prayer, and let prayer strengthen watchfulness. By keeping guard over everything that arises within, watchfulness will see how the enemy tries to enter. At the same time, it will call upon the Lord Jesus Christ, Who drives away the demons and their fantasies. In this way, watchfulness blocks their entry, while Jesus Himself, when invoked, scatters them (Text 25).

(9) Guard your mind with great vigilance. The moment you notice a hostile thought, reject it at once, but also call quickly upon Christ the Lord to act on your behalf. Even as you cry to Him, the sweetest Jesus answers: *“Here I am, with you, to defend you.”* Yet once your enemies have been subdued by prayer, you must not relax, but keep guarding your mind diligently. For new waves of thoughts will rush at you, more numerous than before, until the soul feels nearly drowned by them and on the verge of perishing. But Jesus, like He did for the disciples, rebukes the storm of evil thoughts, and suddenly there is calm \[Luke 8:23–24]. And having been delivered, whether for a short while or for a longer rest, you must glorify the One who saved you and return to meditating on death (Text 26).

(10) Continue in your struggles with earnest watchfulness, guided by wisdom. When joined daily, watchfulness and prayer become like Elijah’s fiery chariot, lifting the one who practices them up toward heaven. What do I mean? The pure heart, established in watchfulness, becomes itself a heaven for the intellect—with its own sun, moon, and stars. And through mystical contemplation and ecstasy, the heart becomes a living vessel of the uncontainable God (Text 27).

**(3) The Teaching of Theoliptus, Metropolitan of
Philadelphia (Dobrotolyubiye, part II, pages 44–50)**

(1) When the sun sets, night comes; and when Christ withdraws from the soul, it is covered by the darkness of passions, and wild beasts of thoughts rise up to torment it. Just as the physical sun makes the beasts hide in their dens, when Christ rises and shines upon the praying mind, worldly concerns fade away, and the mind devotes itself to divine knowledge until the “setting of the sun.”

(2) Avoid idle conversations and resist interior thoughts until you reach pure prayer and the dwelling-place of Christ, who enlightens and fills you with His knowledge and presence.

(3) Footprints in snow vanish when the sun melts the snow or when water washes them away. In the same way, the memory of sensual acts is erased by Christ, who illumines the heart through prayer, and is washed away by tears of contrition.

(4) When prayer is filled with ardent tenderness, it blots out the memories of past sins. Constant remembrance of God, joined with faith and a contrite heart, cuts away bad memories like a razor.

(5) Find a quiet place and strive to enter into the innermost secret chamber of your soul—the watchtower—where Christ dwells, and where peace, joy, and stillness are always present. There, Christ, the Sun who shines upon the intellect, bestows His gifts, which radiate from Him like rays, as a reward for the soul that welcomes Him with faith and love for all that is good.

(6) Sit in your cell and keep your mind fixed on God alone. Set aside every other thought, pour out your heart to Him, and cling to Him in love. To remember God is for the mind to contemplate Him, drawn by His presence and illumined by His radiance. When the mind turns to God free from all images and forms, its contemplation becomes pure and imageless.

(7) Prayer is the mind speaking with the Lord—uttering words while holding its attention on Him. When the Name of the Lord is repeated with focus and the mind listens clearly to this invocation, the light of divine contemplation embraces the whole soul like a radiant cloud.

(8) Believe me, if everything you do is united with prayer—the mother of all virtues—prayer will not rest until it has led you into the bridal chamber of Christ, filling you with indescribable joy and delight. Prayer removes obstacles, smooths the path to virtue, and makes it open and accessible to all who seek it.

(9) As you walk the spiritual path, recite the words of prayer without ceasing. Cry out to the Lord and never give in to despair. Be persistent, like the widow who moved the unjust judge. Then you will walk in the Spirit, overcome the desires of the flesh, and keep your prayer uninterrupted by worldly distractions. In this way, your soul becomes a temple of God, silently filled with His praise. Eventually, this prayer of the mind will lead you into unceasing remembrance of God, into the hidden treasures of the spirit, and into the vision of the Unseen through mystical contemplation. Alone in your solitude, you will worship the one true God with a love that flows from your heart and is known only to you.

**(4) The Teachings of Saint Barsanuphius the Great and Saint John the Prophet**

(1) The enemies of the soul are weakened when the Name of God is invoked. Knowing this, we must never cease to call upon His Name for help. This is true prayer, as Scripture teaches: “Pray without ceasing” \[1 Thess. 5:17].

(2) Remember that God knows the heart and sees into it. Call on Him there, for Scripture says: “Shut your door and pray to your Father who is in the secret place” \[Matt. 6:6]. Seal your lips and pray inwardly; he who does this fulfills the command.

(3) Your spiritual effort must center on unceasing prayer from the heart. If you desire to succeed in this, commit yourself, seek without weariness, and hold fast to hope. Then God will grant success.

(4) The constant invocation of the Name of God is healing. It destroys not only the passions but also their activity. Just as a physician prescribes the right treatment to heal a wound—though the patient does not understand how it works—so too the Name of God, when invoked, heals the soul and eradicates the passions in ways beyond our comprehension.

(5) The Lord said, “Ask, and it will be given to you” \[Luke 11:9]. So pray to the all-good God to send you the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, who will teach you everything and reveal every mystery. Make Him your guide, and He will not allow deception or confusion to enter your heart. He will keep your thoughts from falling into laziness, negligence, or sleepiness. He will open your eyes, strengthen your heart, and lift up your mind. Cling to Him. Trust Him. Love Him.

(6) If you see that the enemy’s cunning snares are disturbing your prayer, do not argue with him. Instead, call on the Name of God, and He will help you and scatter the enemy’s schemes.

(7) Perfect prayer is speaking with God in a mind that is gathered, still, and undistracted. A person enters such prayer when he becomes dead to people, the world, and everything in it. In such a state, while praying, he thinks only of standing before God and speaking with Him.

**C. The Most Edifying Narrative of Abba Philemon**

(1) It is said about Abba Philemon the Hermit that he enclosed himself in a cave not far from a lavra called Romyeva and gave himself wholly to ascetic struggle. Following the example of the great Arsenius, as tradition tells, he would regularly ask himself: *Philemon, why have you come here?*

He stayed in this cave for a long time, spending his days twisting twine and weaving baskets, which he exchanged with a steward for small loaves of bread. His food was only bread and salt, and not even every day. Clearly, he gave no thought to bodily comfort but devoted himself entirely to contemplation. He lived in divine illumination, gaining knowledge of mysteries beyond words and dwelling in spiritual light.

On Saturdays and Sundays, on his way to church, he walked in deep contemplation, allowing no one to approach him, so his mind would not be pulled away from the interior life. In church, he stood quietly in a corner, head bowed, tears streaming from his eyes in unceasing sorrow, while his mind rested in his heart, fixed on the example of the Holy Fathers, especially Arsenius the Great, whose path he sought to follow.

(2) When a heresy arose in Alexandria and its surroundings, Philemon departed and went to the Lavra of Nikinarov, where the God-loving Paulinus welcomed him and gave him his own secluded dwelling so that Philemon might live in complete silence. For a full year, Paulinus let no one visit Philemon and did not trouble him himself, except to bring him bread. Then, on the holy Feast of the Resurrection of Christ, they met and began to speak together about the hermit’s life. It was then Philemon saw that the devout Paulinus also had the noble desire for solitude, and that the teachings—spoken and written—about the ascetic way had taken deep root in his heart. For all such teachings testify that without complete solitude it is not possible to please God.

The divinely inspired Moses once said: *“Silence gives birth to great ascetic feats, which in turn give birth to tears; tears give birth to fear, and fear to humility. Humility opens the eyes, and then love is born. It is love that makes the soul healthy and free from passion—and then man knows he is not far from God.”*

(3) Philemon then said to Paulinus:

“You must purify your mind completely by embracing silence and using it only for spiritual exercises. Just as the physical eye marvels at what it sees when it looks upon something in the world, so too does a purified intellect marvel when it turns its gaze to the unseen. The soul becomes enraptured with what the spiritual eye beholds, and nothing can tear its attention away. To the extent that the mind is made dispassionate and cleansed through silence, to that same measure will it be granted knowledge of heavenly things.

A mind reaches perfection when it partakes of divine knowledge and union with God. In such dignity it becomes royal in stature, lacking nothing, and even if it were offered all the kingdoms of the world, it would not be drawn to earthly desires.

If you desire such blessings, flee quickly from the world and follow earnestly the path of the saints. Do not be concerned with outward appearance; instead, clothe yourself in poverty and adorn yourself with humility. Let your way of being be plain and unpretentious. Speak with sincerity. Avoid arrogance and pomp in your manner of life. Learn how to live in poverty and how to be unnoticed by others.

Above all, guard your mind with watchfulness. Be patient in trials, and strive to preserve undefiled the grace that you have already received. Keep strict watch over yourself, rejecting every secret delight that seeks to creep inside. For although silence subdues the passions, if you give them fuel, they will flare up violently and overpower you more fiercely than before—just as bodily wounds, when scratched and torn, cannot heal.

A single word can turn the mind away from the remembrance of God, if the demons press upon you and the senses give way. Therefore, the guarding of the soul demands an awesome and extraordinary effort!”

“And so, you must completely withdraw from the world and free your soul from being tied to the body. Become as one with no city, no home, no possessions or wealth, no desire to own anything. Let go of all cares and companions, and keep yourself unaware of worldly affairs. Be humble, gentle, kind, meek, and quiet in spirit—ready to receive the imprint of divine knowledge in your heart. For, as Saint Basil the Great teaches, you cannot write on a wax tablet unless the earlier writing is first erased.

So too with the saints: by renouncing the ways of the world and keeping within themselves the quiet contemplation of heavenly things, they were illumined by divine law and became shining examples of righteous words and deeds. They put to death the earthly passions through fasting, the fear of God, and love. Through unceasing prayer and meditation on the Scriptures, the inner eyes of the heart were opened, gazing on the Lord of Hosts with great joy.

A divine, irresistible longing is kindled in the soul, and by the Spirit it even lifts the body, so that the whole person becomes spiritual. This is what is given to those who embrace holy stillness and walk the narrow path of the ascetic life: having given up human consolations, they enjoy unceasing communion, alone with the Lord of heaven.”

(4) After hearing this, that brother’s heart was pierced with divine love. He left his home and went with Philemon to the skete where the great holy fathers had lived in righteousness. Together they made their home in the Lavra of Saint John Kolobos. Because they longed for a life of silence, they entrusted their needs to the steward of the Lavra. And so, by God’s grace, they lived in deep stillness—leaving their cells only on Saturdays and Sundays for the services, and spending the rest of the time in prayer and quiet. Each followed the monastic rule privately, devoting himself to prayer.

(5) Philemon, the holy elder, kept this pattern: at night, with patience, he chanted the entire Psalter along with the nine canticles, and then read the beginning of a Gospel. Afterward, he sat and for a long time silently repeated, *Lord, have mercy.* When at last he could no longer pray these words, he would rest in sleep. At dawn, he chanted the First Hour, then turned to the East and alternated between chanting psalms and reading from the Epistles and Gospels. In this way his whole day was filled with psalmody, prayer, and the sweetness of divine contemplation. At times his mind was caught up so deeply in God that he no longer knew whether he was in heaven or on earth.

(6) Seeing how earnestly he prayed, how faithfully he kept the rule, and how at times his very face seemed to shine in mystical contemplation, a brother once asked him, “Father, is it not hard for you, in old age, to burden your body so much?” He answered, “Believe me, God has placed such zeal and love for prayer in my soul that I cannot even keep up with its desire. Love for God and the hope of future blessings overcome all weakness of the body.” And so his deep longing lifted his mind into heaven—even during meals, not only at other times.

(7) A brother who lived with Philemon once asked him, “What mysteries does mystical contemplation reveal?” Seeing the man’s persistence and his sincere longing, Philemon answered gently, “My child, to the one who has fully purified his mind, God grants visions of the Powers and the angelic ranks who serve Him.”

(8) Another time, the same brother asked, “Father, why do you delight so much in the Psalter above all other books of Scripture? And why, when you chant quietly, does it seem as though you are speaking with someone?” Philemon replied, “God has pressed the psalms into my soul with the same power He gave to David. I cannot pull myself away from the joy of the hidden revelations within them. For in truth, they hold within themselves the fullness of all Scripture.”

(9) One day a brother named John, who had traveled from the coast, came to visit the holy elder. Bowing at his feet, he said, “What must I do, Father, to be saved? My mind wanders everywhere it should not.” Philemon paused in silence, then answered, “This sickness belongs to those who are overly fixed on what is external. It afflicts you because you have not yet come into a perfect love of God—you have not yet come to truly know and love Him in intimacy.”

The brother asked, “Then what should I do, Father?” Philemon said, “Go and learn the hidden knowledge of the heart, and it will cleanse your mind of this sickness.” Not understanding, the brother asked, “What is this secret knowledge, Father?” Philemon replied, “Practice watchfulness within your heart, and with attention, with reverence and humility, pray: *Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.* This is what the blessed Diadochus teaches all who are beginning the path.”

(10) The brother went away, and with God’s help through the prayers of the elder, he found peace and even a measure of delight in what he had been taught. But soon the sweetness faded, and he could no longer keep watch over his heart or pray as before. So he returned to the elder and told him what had happened.

The elder said, “Now that you have tasted the silence and the prayer of the mind, and have known the sweetness it brings, you must hold it close in your heart at all times—whether you are eating or drinking, speaking with someone, traveling, or sitting in your cell. With focused thought and an undistracted mind, do not cease from repeating that prayer, from chanting the psalms, and from learning their wisdom. Even in the midst of your daily needs, let your mind never lie empty, but train it in hidden study and prayer.

“If you do this, you will come to see the deeper meaning of Holy Scripture and discover the hidden power within it. Your mind will learn to pray without stopping, and you will fulfill the Apostle’s command: *Pray without ceasing.* Be diligent in watchfulness. Guard your heart from all vain, idle, or harmful thoughts. In secret, let your heart alternate between learning from the psalms and praying, *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me.* Do this always—when you sleep and when you wake, when you eat, drink, or speak with others. And when your lips chant the psalms, take care that it is not only your mouth that speaks, while your mind drifts elsewhere.”

(11) The brother then said, “Father, I am troubled by many vain dreams in my sleep.” The elder answered, “Do not be afraid, and do not give in to laziness. Before you sleep, fill your heart with many prayers. Resist the thoughts and temptations of the devil, and God Himself will shield you. Do all you can to fall asleep with the psalms still on your lips and your mind resting on what you have learned. Never let your mind drift into careless or foreign thoughts. Go to bed with the same thoughts that shaped your prayers, so that they may stay with you through the night and greet you again when you awaken. And before sleep, recite the Creed, for confessing the true faith in God is both the source and the safeguard of every blessing.”

(12) Again the brother asked, “Father, will you tell me the spiritual exercises you practice in your heart? Teach me, so that I too may be saved.” The elder hesitated, asking, “Why do you want to know this?” But the brother rose, embraced his feet, and pleaded with him earnestly. After some time, the elder said, “You are not yet ready to bear such things. To discipline each of the senses rightly belongs to the one who is strong and tested, who already lives in the blessings of spiritual truth. It is not possible for one still entangled in worldly thoughts to receive such a gift.

“But if you truly desire this, then hold fast to what you already know—guard the secret knowledge of the heart in purity. If you persevere in unceasing prayer and meditation on the Scriptures, the eyes of your soul will open. You will know a great joy and a burning sweetness that cannot be put into words, even a warmth in your body that comes from the Spirit—until your whole being is made spiritual. And if God grants you, whether by day or night, the grace to pray with a pure mind, then set aside your prayer rule and give all your strength to clinging to God. He Himself will illumine your heart and show you the way of the life you have begun.”

Then the elder added, “A holy elder once came to me, and I asked him about the state of his mind. He said, ‘I prayed before God for two full years, begging Him with all my heart to grant me the gift of unceasing, undistracted prayer—the very prayer He gave to His disciples. And the generous Lord, seeing my labors and my patience, granted my desire.’”

And this is what else he told him:

“Vain thoughts that rise up in the soul are the sickness of an idle heart weighed down by negligence. This is why the Scriptures teach us to guard the mind with care, to chant the psalms with understanding, and to pray with a pure heart. Brother, God desires that we first show Him our zeal—through effort, through spiritual struggle, through good works—and then through love and unceasing prayer. In this way He shows us the path of salvation. Truly, there is no road to heaven except this: to turn away from all evil, to embrace what is good, to love God with all our heart, and to live in communion with Him in reverence and truth. Whoever attains this will rise to join the choirs of heaven.

“But the one who wishes to ascend must put to death what is earthly in himself. For when the soul tastes the joy of true blessedness, it no longer desires the passions that sinful pleasures stir up. Instead, it lays aside bodily and sensual cravings, and receives the vision of God with thoughts that are pure and undefiled. Therefore, we must keep strict watch over ourselves. We must endure hardship of body and cleansing of soul, so that God may find a dwelling place in our hearts. Then, keeping His commandments without falling into sin, we will learn by His grace to remain faithful. For it is the Spirit Himself who teaches us, and His light in the heart shines out as naturally as the rays of the sun.”

“We must labor diligently and endure many trials in order to purify within ourselves the image in which we were first created—as beings capable of receiving God’s light and growing into His likeness. By cleansing our senses through the furnace of trials, we keep them pure and undefiled, and so we are raised into the dignity of a royal calling. God made human nature able to share in every blessing, with an intellect fit to behold the unapproachable Light and the surpassing Glory, even the ranks of angels—the dominions, powers, principalities, and thrones.

“But when you gain any virtue, take care not to think yourself greater than your brother who has not, for that is the seed of pride. And when you are battling a passion, do not fall into despair or fear because it presses you so hard. Instead, set your heart to resist it, then fall down before God and cry out as the prophet did: *Plead my cause, O Lord, with those who strive against me, for I am powerless against them!* In your humility, He will quickly come to your aid.

“And if you are traveling with a companion, do not waste yourself in idle talk. Keep your mind at work with its familiar spiritual exercises. In this way it will keep its good habits, forget worldly pleasures, and remain in the safe harbor of dispassion.”

After speaking of these things, and many more, the elder let the brother go.

(13) After a short time, the brother returned and said, “Father, what should I do? When I try to keep my prayer rule at night, I become so sleepy that I cannot continue with attention or keep vigil for long. I feel like I need some work for my hands while I chant the psalms.”

The elder answered, “When you are able to pray with attention, do not distract yourself with work. But when drowsiness overtakes you, resist it as best you can, and then take up some work with your hands.”

The brother asked again, “Father, do you not also become sleepy during your prayers?” The elder replied, “Not so easily. But if sleepiness lingers and I begin to feel its weight, I take up the Gospels, beginning with John, and read while lifting my mind’s eye to God. Then the drowsiness disappears. I treat thoughts in the same way—when they assail me, I quench them with my tears as one puts out a flame, and they vanish. You are not yet able to resist thoughts like this, so it is better for you to hold fast to your spiritual lessons and to recite faithfully the daily prayers given by the Fathers—the Hours, the Third, the Sixth, the Ninth, and Vespers, along with the night services.

“With all your strength, avoid doing anything merely to please others. Guard your heart against any animosity toward your brothers, for such things cut you off from God. Keep watch over your mind so it does not scatter, but instead learns to dwell on what is within. When you are in church preparing to receive the Holy Mysteries of Christ, do not leave afterward until you are filled with peace. Choose one place to stand and do not move until the Dismissal. And within yourself, remember that you are in heaven among the holy angels, standing in God’s presence, preparing to receive Him into your heart. Approach this with fear and trembling, lest you find yourself unworthy of such communion with the heavenly host.”

After strengthening the brother in this way and entrusting him to the care of the Lord and His Spirit of grace, the elder let him go.

(14) A brother who lived with the elder later shared this story:

“Once, while sitting with him, I asked if he had ever been attacked by the revilement of demons during his time in solitude. He replied, ‘Forgive me, brother, but if God were to allow you to suffer the same temptations I have endured, I do not believe you could withstand their bitter sting. I am more than seventy years old now and have suffered many trials in various solitary places. It would not benefit those who have never lived in solitude to hear about the sharpness of these wounds.

‘But I will tell you this: through it all I held to one rule. I placed my whole trust in God and vowed to renounce everything else. And God swiftly rescued me from calamity. For this reason, I no longer worry about providing for my needs. I can endure temptations more easily now, for I know He will provide. The only thing I can give Him is my unceasing prayer. And remember this, brother—it is no small thing to believe that every sorrow and misfortune adds to the weaving of a crown of glory for the one who suffers, for the Righteous Judge weighs them out in perfect balance.

‘So do not fall into faintheartedness. If you have entered the arena to fight—then fight! Take courage, knowing that those who stand with us against the enemies of God far outnumber the enemy hosts. For how could we even dare to stand against such a terrible foe of the human race if the strong hand of the Lord were not upholding us, guarding and shielding us? How could human weakness ever endure such assaults of evil? As Job describes: *Who can open the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around? Out of his mouth come fiery torches; sparks of fire shoot out. His nostrils belch smoke like a boiling cauldron. His breath kindles coals, and flames issue forth. His heart is hard as stone, unyielding as a millstone. He churns the depths like a pot and leaves the sea fuming like incense. He leaves a glittering path behind him… He looks the proud in the eye; of all the sons of pride, he is king* \[Job 41].’”

“This, brother, is the one we are up against! These are the words that describe that tyrant. Yet those who live the solitary life as it is meant to be lived overcome him with ease—because there is nothing of his evil left in them, because they have renounced the world, because they have gained strength through virtue, and because we have One who fights for us. Tell me, whose nature has not been changed by turning to the Lord and holding the holy fear of Him in mind? Who, by filling himself with God’s law and good works, has not clothed his soul with light so that it shines with wisdom and holy thoughts? Such a one never leaves his soul empty, for God dwells within him, stirring his mind to reach endlessly toward the Light.

“And the Spirit will not allow such a soul, so active and alive in God, to falter under the pull of passions. Rather, with royal authority and fierce power, the Spirit rises up against them—driving them off and forbidding them to intrude, striking them down without mercy. A man in such a state will not turn back, but with hands lifted in prayer and with virtues in practice, he will stand victorious in the fight.”

(15) The same brother also shared another virtue of Abba Philemon:

“He could not bear to listen to empty talk. If anyone began speaking of things with no profit for the soul, he would not reply at all. In the same way, when I went out, he never asked why I was leaving; and when I returned, he did not question where I had gone, what I had done, or how.

“Once I had to sail to Alexandria for important business, and from there I went on to Constantinople for church matters. I did not even tell the elder, this servant of God. After being away for a long time, visiting devout brothers in those cities, I returned to the skete. The elder was filled with joy to see me. He welcomed me in his usual manner, prayed, and sat down. Yet he asked me nothing at all, but quietly went on with his spiritual exercises.”

(16) “Once, I decided to test him. For several days I brought him no bread to eat. He never asked for it, nor did he say a word about it. At last I bowed before him and said, ‘Father, forgive me—were you offended that I did not bring you bread as I usually do?’ He answered, ‘Forgive me, brother! Even if you deprived me of bread for twenty days, I would not ask you for it. For as long as my soul endures, so also will my body endure.’ Such was the depth of his absorption in the contemplation of heavenly realities.”

(17) “He would often say, ‘Since the time I came to the skete, I have never allowed my thoughts to wander beyond the walls of my cell. I never let my mind entertain anything except the fear of God and the judgment that awaits us beyond this life. I have never forgotten the final reckoning of sinners, the eternal fire, or the darkness of hell; nor have I forgotten how the souls of the righteous and the unrighteous live after death. I continually reflect on the blessings that await the righteous and how each person is rewarded according to his deeds—one for the labor of spiritual struggle, another for mercy and love, another for generosity and silent solitude, still another for obedience or for a pilgrim’s life. In thinking on all these things, I guard myself from other thoughts, and I can no longer spend time with people or occupy myself with them, lest I be drawn away from my contemplation of the divine.’”

(18) “He once told a story of a solitary ascetic who had reached such freedom from passion that an angel himself brought him bread. But when the man grew lazy and let his watchfulness slip, that gift was taken from him. For when the soul relaxes its careful guard, night falls upon it. Where God’s light does not shine, all becomes dim and shadowed, and the soul can no longer behold the One True God or tremble at His words. As the Lord says: *Am I not God when I am near, and not God also when far away? Can anyone hide in secret places without My seeing him? Do I not fill heaven and earth?*

“He recalled many others who had suffered the same fate. He spoke even of Solomon, who for the sake of a fleeting lust lost the greatness of his name. Though Solomon had been given wisdom that lit up the world as the dawn brightens the morning sky, even he stumbled and fell.

“Therefore, it is dangerous to yield to laziness. We must pray without ceasing, so that no stray thought may draw us from God and take His place in our minds. Only the heart made pure, the heart that becomes the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, can look within itself like a mirror and behold the God who made all things.”

(19) “After hearing this and watching the way he lived,” said the brother who dwelt with Abba Philemon, “I understood that the passions of the flesh had completely lost their hold on him. He loved perfection with such zeal that he seemed continually transfigured by the Spirit, sighing with inexpressible sighs. He was always turned inward, examining himself, keeping a careful balance within as though weighing everything on scales, determined not to let a single stray thought cloud the purity of his mind or leave even the faintest stain upon him.

“Seeing this, I was filled with longing to live as he did. I begged him, ‘Father, how can I gain the purity of mind that you have?’ He replied, ‘You must work hard, my child, for this requires much struggle and suffering of the heart. Spiritual treasures, which are worth all effort and zeal, will not come to us while we lounge in comfort. Whoever wishes to succeed in the spiritual life must first renounce all desires, must seek tears of repentance, and must crave nothing. He must overlook the sins of others and grieve only for his own, weeping over them day and night. He must avoid vain dealings with people. For the soul that laments its own poverty and remembers its transgressions dies to the world, and the world dies to it. Then the passions lose their power.

‘The one who renounces the world, who clings to Christ, who dwells in silence and solitude, loves God. He preserves God’s image within himself and grows into His likeness. Such a one will receive the gift of the Spirit from above, becoming a dwelling place for God, not for demons, offering all his works as a gift to the Lord. The soul that lives in this purity, undefiled and uncorrupted, will at last be crowned with the crown of truth and shine with the beauty of virtue.

‘But hear this also: if one begins the spiritual life without sorrow of heart, without true tears of repentance, without the memory of eternal judgment burning within him; if he does not hold to silence, unceasing prayer, psalmody, and the study of divine Scripture until they become second nature—engraved on his soul so that even against his will his mind is compelled toward them; if the fear of God does not reign in him—then such a one is still bound to the world and cannot pray with a pure heart. For only reverence and the fear of God cleanse the soul of passions. Only then is the mind set free to do what is most natural to it: to contemplate God, and to taste the blessing of which Christ spoke: *Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.* For the one who has received this vision, it becomes a pledge of what is to come, preserving his inner state unshaken.

‘Therefore, with all our strength, let us strive to live by the rule of the spiritual life. This life of virtue and holy struggle raises us into the purity of mind, and the fruit of that purity is contemplation—the natural work of the intellect. The practice of the rule is nothing less than the ascent itself, as Gregory the Theologian, filled with divine light, has said. If we neglect this practice, we estrange ourselves from true wisdom. Even the one who climbs to the height of virtue must continue to labor tirelessly, taming the impulses of the flesh, guarding his thoughts with exactness. And even then, it is only with effort and force that we make room for Christ to dwell within our hearts.

‘For the more we grow in righteousness, the stronger and more mature we become, until the mind at last is perfected. Then it clings wholly to God and is illumined by His divine light, which discloses mysteries beyond words. The mind comes to a true, intimate knowledge of all things—where wisdom dwells, where power abides, where the knowledge of all truth resides, where length of days and life itself are found, where the light of the eyes and perfect peace are given.’”

“For as long as a person still struggles with the passions, he cannot yet taste these delights. Both virtues and vices veil the mind—vices keep it from seeing virtue, and even virtues can keep it from recognizing its own hidden faults. But when the soul finds peace after its battles and is granted the gifts of the Spirit, then grace works upon it constantly. It is transfigured by light, lifted into a steady vision of spiritual realities. Such a soul is no longer chained to the things of this world, but has passed from death into life.

“The one who longs to live this way, who zealously seeks God, must keep both heart and lips pure. Then the words that rise from his mouth will also be pure, and they will glorify God rightly. For the soul that clings to God converses with Him continually.

“So let us desire this perfection of virtue. Let us cut the cords that bind us to the passions. The one who labors and comes near to God—who shares in His holy light and is wounded by love for Him—that person rejoices in a spiritual delight beyond words. As the psalmist says: *Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart… He will make your righteousness shine like the light, and your justice like the noonday sun.*

“And what love is stronger, more irresistible, than the love God pours into a soul cleansed of evil? It is such a soul that can cry with truth and purity: *I am lovesick* \[Song of Songs 2:5]. The splendor of God’s beauty cannot be spoken. Words fall short; ears cannot contain the sound of it. The light of day, the brightness of the moon, the radiance of the sun—all are nothing in comparison. In the presence of that true light, even the noonday sun is dimmer than the darkest night before it. Saint Basil, marvelous among teachers, taught us this truth—for he himself had seen it with his own eyes.”

(20) The brother who lived with Abba Philemon shared many things, but he said this as well, which shows the elder’s deep humility. Though he had long ago been ordained a priest, and though his life and mind had already risen heavenward with sincerity, he still avoided serving at the altar. He considered it a heavy burden. In all his years of ascetic struggle, he rarely agreed to officiate at the Divine Liturgy. And even though he lived in constant watchfulness, he often refrained from receiving Communion if he had spoken with others beforehand—even when his words were only of spiritual benefit and not at all worldly.

When he did prepare to receive the Holy Mysteries, he gave himself first to long prayer, to psalmody, and to heartfelt confession, begging God for mercy. At the moment of hearing the words, *The holy things are for the holy,* he was seized with fear and awe. He would say that, in that moment, the whole church was filled with angels, and that the King Himself presided invisibly, consecrating the bread and wine as His own Body and Blood. And through Holy Communion, He came to dwell in our hearts.

For this reason, the elder would say, we must dare to approach the Mysteries only with purity and chastity—as though free from every tie of the flesh—and without doubt or hesitation, so that we might receive the light poured out through them. Many of the saints even saw angels guarding them after Communion, shielding them from all harm. It is for this reason they remained in silence afterward, speaking with no one.

(21) And here is something else the brother remembered: when the elder himself had to go out to sell the work of his hands, he would stand in silence and feign being simple-minded. In this way he avoided lies, oaths, idle talk, or any other sin that might arise from bargaining and conversation. Whoever wished to buy what he made would simply take it and give him whatever payment they chose.

This great lover of wisdom wove only small baskets, and whatever he received for them, he accepted with gratitude—without a word.
