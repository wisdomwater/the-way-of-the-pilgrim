## The Teachings of the Holy Fathers on the Interior Prayer of the Heart

**A. First Category**

**(1) The Teaching of Saint Simeon the New Theologian**

Saint Simeon the New Theologian explains the way of entering the heart in what he calls his third method of prayer (Article 68, page 163, Russian translation, 2nd edition):

“The third method of prayer is truly splendid and difficult to explain. For those who have not experienced it, it is not only hard to understand but even seems impossible. In our time, very few practice this way of prayer, though it alone destroys the traps and snares that demons use to draw the mind toward countless thoughts. For only when the mind is free from all things can it, unhindered, examine the suggestions of the demons, resist them with ease, and offer its prayers to God with a pure heart.”

After naming the conditions for this prayer—perfect obedience and a clean conscience toward God, people, and all things—and urging us to act as if always standing before the face of God, he continues:

“By doing this, you will prepare a sure and reliable path to this third way of prayer, which is this: while the heart prays, the mind must guard it, and it must steadily keep its attention within, offering prayers to God from the depths of the heart.

*“Everything lies in this: work at it until you truly experience and taste communion with the Lord. When the mind is firmly established in the heart, when it tastes and knows with the heart how good the Lord is, it will not want to leave that place. Then the mind will say, as Saint Peter once said: ‘It is good for us to be here’ \[Matt. 17:4]. And it will always gaze into the heart, and always commune with it there, while driving away every thought sown by the enemy.”

“To those who do not understand this practice and who have no experience of it, it may seem difficult or burdensome. But those who have tasted its sweetness and felt its delight deep in their hearts cry out with Saint Paul: *‘Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?’* \[Rom. 8:35].

“For the Lord Himself has said, *‘Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies… These are the things which defile a man’* \[Matt. 15:19–20]. And again, *‘Cleanse the inside of the cup and the dish, that the outside of them may be clean also’* \[Matt. 23:26]. Because of this, our Holy Fathers set aside all other forms of spiritual activity and gave themselves wholly to this one thing: guarding the heart. They were convinced that through it they would quickly acquire every virtue, but without it they would not gain even one.

“They all practiced this above all else, and they wrote about it. Whoever wishes can read what Mark the Wrestler taught, or John of the Ladder, or Hesychius of Jerusalem, Philotheus of Sinai, Abba Isaiah, Barsanuphius the Great, and others.

“And if you wish to learn the way to do this—how to enter the heart and dwell there—I will tell you.

“Before all else, you must keep three things: freedom from every care—whether good, bad, or vain—so that you are, in a sense, dead to all things; a clear conscience in everything, so that it does not accuse you; and complete dispassion, so that your thoughts are not drawn to anything. Then sit alone in a quiet place and close the door. Turn your mind away from thoughts of all worldly and passing things. Bow your head, rest your chin on your chest, and direct your attention inward—not into your head, but into your heart. Fix both your inner gaze and even your outward eyes there, and regulate your breathing. With your mind in this place, try in every way to find the seat of the heart, so that once you discover it, your mind will remain there.

“At first, you will feel darkness and hardness inside. But if day and night you keep practicing this, you will gradually discover a hidden joy. By compelling the mind to persist in this exercise, it will find the place of the heart, and there, within, it will see things it had never before seen or known. From that moment, no matter where a thought arises or how it tries to appear—before it can enter or be entertained—the mind will instantly reject it and drive it out with the words of Jesus’ Name: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.’*

“Then the mind will even acquire a holy anger toward the demons, and it will begin to chase them away and defeat them. As for the other fruits of this practice, with God’s help, you will come to know them yourself, through keeping watch over your attention and clinging to Jesus through His prayer: *‘Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!’”*

**(2) The Teaching of Saint Gregory of Sinai**

Saint Gregory of Sinai gives his teaching on the interior prayer of the heart—and on how it becomes a steady and natural practice—in three of his writings on silence and prayer, found in the *Dobrotolyubiye* (part I, pages 112–119). What follows is a summary of his counsel.

Having received the Spirit of life in Jesus Christ, we are called to live like the cherubim—conversing with the Lord through the pure prayer of the heart. Yet we often fail to recognize the greatness and honor of this gift of rebirth. Neglecting our growth in the commandments, our minds never rise to true contemplation. Instead, we slip into negligence, give in to our passions, and sink into darkness and insensitivity.

We forget God, or remember Him only rarely. Though we believe, our faith remains inactive. Baptized into new life, we still live according to the flesh. Even when we repent, our obedience is shallow, not spiritual, and we drift so far from the true life of the Spirit that, when we see others living it, it can appear strange—or even like delusion. And so, many live out their days with a dead spirit, not in Christ, though *what is born of the Spirit must be spiritual*.

This gift, given at Baptism, is never destroyed—but it lies buried within us like a treasure hidden in the ground. Wisdom and gratitude call us to uncover it. How do we do this?

There are two ways:

1. By striving with great effort to keep the commandments. The more faithfully we keep them, the more brightly this hidden gift will shine.
2. By unceasingly invoking the Name of Jesus Christ, or by constant remembrance of God, which amounts to the same thing.

The first path is strong, but it finds its full power in the second. Therefore, if we truly desire to uncover the blessed seed planted in us, we must not delay in taking up this second way—this rule of the heart. By persisting in the unseen and formless prayer of the heart, it will begin to grow warm, until it bursts into flame with an inexpressible love for the Lord.

The activity of this prayer in the heart can happen in two ways. Sometimes the mind leads, clinging to the Lord in the heart through constant remembrance. Other times, the prayer itself stirs first, awakening with the flame of joy, and draws the mind down into the heart, holding it there before the Lord.

In the first case, the practice of prayer begins to show itself as the passions weaken—through keeping the commandments and through the warmth that grows in the heart by calling on the Lord Jesus. In the second case, it is the Spirit who draws the mind into the heart, uniting them in the depths and restraining the mind from its usual wandering.

In both forms, prayer works in two modes: sometimes active, sometimes contemplative. Active prayer fights, with God’s help, against the passions; contemplative prayer fixes its gaze on God, as much as is possible for us.

Active mental prayer of the heart is practiced in this way: Sit on a low stool, no higher than about seven inches. Draw your mind down from your head into your heart and hold it there. Then, with both mind and heart, call out: *Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me!* Keep your breathing steady, not uncontrolled, so that your thoughts are not scattered. If you notice thoughts appearing, pay them no attention—whether they seem simple and good or vain and impure. By confining the mind in the heart and patiently repeating the Lord’s Name, you will overcome them. You will drive them away with the unseen power of Christ’s Name. As Saint John of the Ladder says: *“With the Name of Jesus flog your foes, for there is no surer weapon against them, in heaven or on earth.”*

If the mind becomes weary during this practice, and if the body and heart ache from the strain of uniting mind and heart in the constant invocation of the Lord Jesus, then stand and chant the psalms, or reflect on a passage of Scripture, or meditate on death. You might also read a little, or take up some manual work, or find another task to steady yourself.

When engaging in this work of prayer, it is best to read only books that deal with the inner life—sobriety and prayer. Read John of the Ladder, Isaac the Syrian, the ascetic writings of Maximus the Confessor, Simeon the New Theologian, Hesychius, Philotheus of Sinai, and other similar Fathers. For a time, set aside other writings—not because they are harmful, but because while you are pursuing this practice, they can distract your mind from prayer. Do not read excessively; rather, take in what you read carefully and make it your own.

Do not abandon prayer books entirely. Some keep many rules of prayer with strictness; others leave them behind altogether and turn only to the prayer of the mind. You should walk a middle path. Do not take on too many prayers, which will only scatter your attention, but do not neglect them altogether in times of weakness or illness. If you find that prayer has begun to work within you, flowing in the heart on its own, do not put it aside to take up the prayer book. That would be to leave God within, only to go outside and speak to Him from afar.

Those who have not yet received this gift of self-acting prayer should keep many prayers, even to the point of weariness, so that their hearts remain constantly immersed in prayer until, at last, the warmth of grace sparks the true prayer of the heart. The Fathers teach that when this gift of grace is received, one should reduce formal prayers and give more space to the prayer of the mind. And when the heart is weak, one can lean on prayers or on the writings of the Fathers. For just as oars are used when the wind fails, but laid aside when the sails are full, so written prayers are for when the Spirit seems quiet—but when the Spirit fills the heart, prayer itself carries you forward.

He who weeps with true contrition in prayer holds a mighty weapon against his enemies and against slipping from the joy of prayer into pride. Whoever guards this mingling of sorrow and joy will be kept safe from harm. Genuine interior prayer—free from delusion—radiates a gentle warmth born of the Jesus Prayer, a fire that burns in the soil of the heart and scorches away the passions like weeds. It fills the heart with peace and joy, not from left or right, nor even from above, but rising from within, like a spring flowing from the life-giving Spirit. Love this prayer above all else, guard it carefully within, and protect your mind from fantasies and daydreams. Fear nothing when this prayer is with you, for the One who said, *“Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid,”* is with us.

**(3) The Teaching of Nicephorus the Solitary**

Nicephorus the Solitary sets out his teaching on entering the heart in his *Discourse on Sobriety and the Guarding of the Heart* (Dobrotolyubiye, part II, pages 36–43):

“You who long to feel the divine fire in your heart and to experience the Kingdom of God within—draw near, and I will teach you the art of eternal life. It is an art that leads those who practice it, without toil or sweat, into the haven of dispassion. Through the Fall we went outside of ourselves; let us now return inward, turning our backs on what is outside. We cannot be reconciled with God or united with Him unless we first return to ourselves, coming back within from the life we live outwardly. The interior life is the only true Christian life. All the Fathers testify to this.”

A brother once asked Abba Agathon, “Which is more important, physical labor or guarding the heart?” The elder replied, “Man is like a tree. His physical labor is like the leaves, and guarding the heart is the fruit. And since Scripture says, *‘Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire’* \[Matt. 3:10], it is clear that the focus must be on the fruit—that is, guarding the heart. But we also need the covering of leaves—that is, physical labor.”

**From Saint John of the Ladder**
Saint John says, “Close the door of your cell to your body, the door of your lips to conversations, and the inner door of your soul to evil spirits. When you are in control—that is, when your attention is fixed on your heart—watch, if you are able, how many and what kind of thieves try to enter the vineyard of your heart to steal its clusters of grapes. When the guard grows tired—that is, when the one guarding the heart weakens—let him get up, pray, and then sit down again, returning with courage to the same task of guarding the heart and praying.”

**From Saint Macarius the Great**
Saint Macarius teaches, “The greatest work in all ascetic struggle is to enter into your heart, to hate Satan, and to wage war against him by rejecting his thoughts.”

**From Saint Isaac of Syria**
Saint Isaac writes, “Strive to enter the innermost secret place within yourself, and there you will see the treasures of heaven. The ladder to the Kingdom of God is hidden within you—that is, in your heart. So cleanse yourself of sin, gather yourself inward, and within your heart you will find the rungs by which you may ascend to what is above.”

**From Saint John of Karpathos**
Saint John of Karpathos says, “Great effort and perseverance in prayer are needed to achieve a clear and undisturbed state of mind—that other heaven within the heart where Christ dwells. For as the Apostle says, *‘Do you not know that the Spirit of God dwells in you?’* \[1 Cor. 3:16].”

**From Saint Simeon the New Theologian**
Saint Simeon the New Theologian writes, “From the time when man was banished from Paradise and cut himself off from God, the devil and his demons have been given the freedom, day and night, to stir up the thoughts of all people invisibly. There is no other way for the mind to guard itself against this than through the constant remembrance of God. Whoever keeps this remembrance engraved within himself is able to protect his thoughts from confusion.”

All the Holy Fathers affirm this.

**From Nicephorus the Solitary**
“Almost everyone who learns this greatest spiritual work does so by being taught by others. Rare are those who, because of their fervent faith, receive it directly from God without a human teacher. That is why it is important to seek an experienced guide. If you cannot find such a one, then turn to God with a contrite heart and tears. Ask Him to help you, and follow what I now tell you.

“You know that when we breathe through our lungs, the air passes through the heart. So, sit down, gather your mind, and guide it inward along the path of your breath. Force your mind to go down with the air you inhale, into your heart, and keep it there. Do not let it wander, as it wishes to. And while you hold it there, do not leave the heart empty—fill it with these words: *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me.* Let your mind repeat them without ceasing, day and night.

“Work hard to grow accustomed to dwelling in this inner place with this prayer, and guard your mind so that it does not leave too soon. At first, the mind will resist, as though it were imprisoned in this inner chamber. But once it grows used to remaining there, it will begin to delight in it. It will rejoice in staying there and will no longer want to leave. Just as a man who returns home from a far-off land is overwhelmed with joy to see his wife and children again, so too, when the mind finds its home in the heart, it is filled with indescribable joy and gladness.”
