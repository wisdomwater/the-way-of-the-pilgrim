# Three Keys to the Interior Treasure - House of Prayer

Found in the Wealth of the Spiritual
Teachings of the Holy Fathers

*Your word I have hidden in my heart…*
—PS. 119:11

*It behooves the mind to be on guard against every deception and to strive for the sublime.*
—KATAPHIGIOTA, CH. 19

Since every person has his own unique character, inclinations, and abilities, he will follow different paths to reach the same goal. In the same way, there are many approaches to attaining the inner work of prayer, as we see in the writings of the Holy Fathers.

Some of the universal ways that lead both to prayer and to the Christian life are these: unconditional obedience, as taught by Simeon the New Theologian; the labor of good works and the effort of spiritual struggle, as the Church sings in its hymns: *Inspired by God, you dedicated yourself to good works and were raised to the pinnacle of contemplation* (troparion to a holy martyr); formal prayer, as when the disciples asked, *“Lord, teach us to pray”* \[Luke 11:1]; and the special gifts of grace, as in the life of Kapso Kalivitis, who after two years of praying to the Mother of God venerated her icon and suddenly felt sweetness and warmth filling his heart; or the young George, whose simple prayers brought him the unexpected gift of unceasing prayer of the heart.

Beyond these, the Holy Fathers also give us other essential methods directly related to interior prayer. They can be summed up in three keys:

1. Constancy in invoking the Name of Jesus Christ.
2. Attention while invoking His Name.
3. The mind entering the heart.

These three practices open the Kingdom of God within us and unlock the treasure of interior prayer in the heart. They are rightly called the keys to this hidden storehouse.

**The First Key**

If repetition shapes habit, and habit shapes nature, then frequent and steady calling on the Name of Jesus Christ—even if distracted at first—will in time lead to attentiveness and warmth of heart. Human nature is capable of forming a disposition through constant repetition. As one spiritual writer put it, if you want to learn to do something well, you must do it often. Saint Hesychius says it plainly: constancy creates habit, and habit becomes second nature.

This can be seen in the practice of interior prayer. The one who longs for it resolves to call on the Name of God constantly, almost without interruption. He begins by verbally repeating the Jesus Prayer: *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.* Sometimes he may use the shorter form: *Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.* Saint Gregory of Sinai teaches that the shorter invocation is easier for beginners, though he does not forbid the longer form. His counsel is simple: fewer words make it easier to grow accustomed to the prayer and to let it take root.

To stir oneself more deeply into unceasing prayer, the one who prays sets a rule: within a given time, he will repeat the prayer a set number of times—hundreds or even thousands throughout the day and night—using the *chotki*. He does not rush but carefully forms each word with his lips and tongue. After a while, the lips and tongue grow so accustomed that they speak the Name of God with almost no effort, as though on their own, even silently.

Then the mind begins to listen to the words being spoken and is slowly drawn away from distraction, turning its focus to the prayer. In time, as the Fathers say, the mind may descend into the heart. When the mind returns to the heart, it warms it with the fire of divine love, and the heart itself—freely, without strain and with indescribable sweetness—begins to call on the Name of Jesus in an unbroken stream of tenderness: *“I sleep, but my heart is awake”* \[Song of Sol. 5:2]. Saint Hesychius describes it beautifully: just as heavy rains soften the earth, so the frequent calling on Christ’s Name softens and gladdens the soil of the heart.

Though this method—handed down through the experience and wisdom of the Fathers—is enough to lead a person into interior prayer, there are also higher ways: attention, and the mind entering the heart. The first is best for beginners, who have not yet learned how to fix their attention or how to work with the heart. It also serves as a preparation for those more advanced practices. But as Nicephorus the Solitary reminds us, because people have different talents and abilities, each must choose the way that suits him best.

**The Second Key**

Attention is the guarding of the mind, as Nicephorus the Solitary says. It is the act of gathering the mind into oneself and fixing it firmly on one subject, cutting off every stray thought and imagining. Saints Callistus and Ignatius, quoting the venerable Nilus, show us how essential this is for prayer: *“Attention that seeks prayer will unfailingly find it. For prayer comes from attention more than from anything else, and so we must guard our attention”* (*Dobrotolyubiye*, part II, chapter 24).

Saint Hesychius teaches the same: *“The more you guard your mind against thoughts, the stronger will be the desire with which you pray to Jesus”* (Text 90). He also writes: *“The air of the heart is filled with joy and stillness as a result of intense attention”* (Text 92). And again: *“Attention is as necessary to prayer as a candle is to a lantern”* (Text 102).

In his teaching on interior prayer, Nicephorus the Solitary concludes that if his guidance does not yet help someone enter the heart, then one should simply pray with as much attention as possible. This, he says with certainty, will in time open the door of the heart and lead to interior prayer. His assurance is drawn from experience.

And Holy Scripture confirms it: union with God cannot be without attention. *“Be still and know that I am God”* \[Ps. 46:10].

And so, the one who desires to reach interior prayer through attention must stay in solitude as much as possible, avoiding unnecessary conversations. He should not rush through his prayers or take on too much at once, but instead go slowly—focusing his mind on the words of prayer as carefully as if he were reading a book. He must push away wandering thoughts and do his best to keep his mind fixed on Jesus, whose Name he invokes, and on His good will, which he seeks. At times, after saying a prayer, he should pause in silence, as though waiting for God’s response, and even when distracted he must strive to return to attentiveness. Above all, he must remember that it is for the Lord’s sake that he has chosen to practice this continual watchfulness, emptying his mind of other thoughts.

**The Third Key**

The third key is entering one’s self—or entering into the heart. Instead of offering our own reflections, let us turn directly to the Holy Fathers and their teaching on this mystery. From their own experience, they have left us clear instructions and reliable guideposts for the way of true interior prayer. For clarity, we can gather their teaching into three groups:

**The First Category**: Fathers who have passed on to us full teachings on the Jesus Prayer—Simeon the New Theologian, Gregory of Sinai, Nicephorus the Solitary, and the monks Ignatius of Xanthopoulos and Callistus.

**The Second Category**: Fathers who have given us brief sayings on interior prayer—Hesychius the Priest of Jerusalem, Philotheus of Sinai, Theoleptus the Metropolitan of Philadelphia, and Barsanuphius with John.

**The Third Category**: *The Most Edifying Narrative of Abba Philemon*, which presents the complete way of a courageous, ascetic, spiritual life.
