# Chapter 6

> *“Brother helped by brother is like a city, strong and tall; it is fortified as a firmly established kingdom.”
—PROV. 18:19*

**Pilgrim:** As I promised when I saw you yesterday, I brought along my esteemed traveling companion—the man whose bright conversation made the road more pleasant, and whom you said you wanted to meet.

**Starets:** I am very glad to see both of you, and I hope my honored guests share that joy. It is a blessing to hear of your experiences. These are my guests: a venerable skhimnik and a Reverend Father. Where two or three are gathered in the name of Jesus Christ, He promised to be present; now that five of us are gathered in His Name, His grace will surely be poured out even more abundantly.

Good friend, the story your traveling companion told me yesterday about your deep devotion to the Holy Gospel was remarkable and enlightening. I would be glad to hear how this devout mystery was revealed to you.

**Professor:** In His great mercy, the abundantly loving Lord—who desires that all be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth—revealed this knowledge to me in a wondrous way, without any human intervention. I was a professor at the Lyceum\* for five years, living a degraded life, swept away by empty secular philosophies rather than by Christ. I might have utterly perished if not for the steady, godly influence of my devout mother and my sister, a serious, unmarried young woman with whom I lived...

“One day, while walking along the main boulevard, I met an extraordinary young man. He told me he was French, well-educated, and had just arrived from Paris in search of a tutoring position. I was impressed by his refinement and his high level of learning. Since he was new in town, I invited him to my home, and we quickly became friends.

For about two months, he often visited me, and sometimes we went out together—seeking amusements and visiting places that, as you can imagine, were not known for their moral atmosphere.

One day, he invited me to join him at such a place, trying to entice me by describing its “special attractions.” But in the middle of his lively description, he suddenly stopped and asked if we could leave my study, where we were sitting, and go to the drawing room.

This struck me as odd. I told him I had noticed before that he seemed reluctant to stay in my study, and I asked him why. I also wanted to keep him there, since the drawing room was next to my mother’s and sister’s rooms, and it would have been inappropriate to have such a conversation within earshot of them.

He tried to offer various excuses, until at last he admitted honestly: “Among the other books on your shelf, I see a New Testament. I respect it so much that I find it difficult to speak of immoral things in its presence. Please, take it out of here, and then we can talk freely.”

Foolishly, I laughed and said, “You should have told me sooner!” I took the New Testament from the shelf, handed it to him, and added, “Here, you put it in the other room.”

The moment the Holy Book touched his hands, he began to tremble violently—and in an instant, he vanished.

I was struck with such horror that I collapsed to the floor in a dead faint. The servants, hearing the commotion, rushed in and tried for half an hour to revive me. When at last I regained consciousness, I was seized with an indescribable fear. My whole body trembled, my hands and feet were numb, and I could not move them. A doctor was called, and he declared that I was suffering from paralysis brought on by a sudden and powerful shock.

“For an entire year after this strange incident—and despite the devoted care of many skilled physicians—I lay bedridden, with no relief in sight. In time, I was forced to resign from my teaching post. My dear, elderly mother passed away during this period, and my sister resolved to enter a monastery. All these sorrows only deepened the weight of my illness.

The only light in those dark days was the New Testament. From the very first moments of my sickness, it had never left my hands. It became both my comfort and my constant reminder of that extraordinary event.

One day, a hermit whom I had never met before appeared at my door, collecting alms for his cloister. He spoke to me gently but firmly, urging me not to rely solely on medicine—“for medicines have no power without the help of God,” he said. “Ask God, and pray diligently, for prayer is the strongest remedy for every illness, both of body and of soul.”

I protested in confusion: “But how can I pray in this state? I can’t even make a single prostration or raise my hand to bless myself with the sign of the cross!”

“At least try to pray somehow,” he replied simply. He offered no further explanation, and soon departed.

Yet his words lingered. My mind began to dwell on prayer—its meaning, its power, its fruits—and I recalled, almost as if by providence, the theology lectures I had once heard as a student. The memory of those spiritual truths warmed my heart. At once, I felt a faint easing of my illness.

The New Testament lay at my side, and since that miraculous encounter I had held a firm faith in its words. I remembered, too, that all those lectures I had heard about prayer were drawn entirely from its pages. It seemed clear to me that the best way to learn about prayer—and about Christian piety itself—was to go straight to the source.

So I began to read the New Testament slowly, carefully, attentively—turning it into a deep and abundant spring from which I drew understanding of the full path to salvation and the true way of interior prayer. I marked every passage that touched on the subject. From that day forward, I have tried to study these divine teachings regularly and to put them into practice as best I can, though not without struggle.

And as I did so, my illness gradually lessened—until at last, as you see now, I was completely restored. Alone in the world, I resolved that in gratitude for God’s fatherly mercy—for His healing and His guidance—I would follow my sister’s example and the call of my own soul. I would consecrate myself to an ascetic life, so that, free from worldly hindrance, I might seek and embrace those sweet words of eternal life which the Scriptures had so generously revealed to me.”

“So now,” the professor continued, “I am making my way toward the secluded skete at the Solovets Monastery by the White Sea—the one called Anzerskiy—which I have heard from a most trustworthy source is perfectly suited for the contemplative life.

I’ll tell you frankly: While the holy New Testament has been my constant comfort on the road, illuminating my still-unripe mind and even warming my cold heart, I cannot hide from you the truth of my weakness. I am afraid—afraid because my heart is both frail and damaged, and because the Gospel sets before us such great demands for doing good works and attaining salvation. It calls for complete self-denial, for tireless spiritual struggle, for a humility deeper than I can yet fathom. And so, I stand between despair and hope… and I do not know what will become of me.”

The skhimnik looked at him earnestly and replied,

“After such a clear and miraculous sign of God’s mercy toward you—and with your level of learning—it is not only wrong but utterly inexcusable for you to give in to despair, or even allow the faintest shadow of doubt to enter your heart about God’s providence and help!

Do you know what the holy ‘Golden-Mouth’—St. John Chrysostom, enlightened by God—teaches about this? He says: *‘No one should ever despair, nor imagine the Gospel commandments to be unattainable or impossible to fulfill! For when God appointed the path for man’s salvation, He did not set down commandments so hard that man would be driven to sin. No! Rather, they were given so that, through their holiness and their life-giving necessity, we might be blessed both in this present life and in eternity.’*”

The skhimnik nodded, his eyes warm but serious.

“Of course,” he said, “to our fallen nature, the steadfast and constant keeping of God’s commandments feels impossibly hard, and so salvation itself may seem out of reach. But the same divine Word that gave us these commandments also gave us the means—not only to fulfill them with ease, but to find consolation in fulfilling them.

“If at first this truth is hidden from you, that is no accident. It is meant to lead the beginner into deeper humility, and to draw him more closely to God, teaching him that his safest refuge is not in his own strength, but in prayer—in calling on His Fatherly help. That is where the mystery of salvation lies—not in trusting our own willpower, but in relying entirely on Him.”

The pilgrim’s face lit up with longing.

“Weak and powerless as I am,” he said, “how I wish I could know this mystery well enough to put it to use—to stir my lazy soul, even a little, toward the glory of God and my salvation!”

The skhimnik smiled gently.

“But you do know it, dear brother,” he replied. “You’ve learned it already from your *Philokalia*. It is the mystery of unceasing prayer—that very prayer you have come to know so well, that you practice so fervently, and that you find so much comfort in.”

The pilgrim bowed his head.

“Reverend Father,” he said with emotion, “for the love of God, let me hear it from your own lips. Speak to me of this mystery of salvation and of this holy prayer, which more than anything else I hunger to hear about, and love to read of—for it strengthens and comforts my poor, sinful soul.”

Although I cannot share much from my own experience about this beautiful spiritual practice, I do have a very helpful work written by a wise spiritual teacher on this very subject. If it pleases you all, I can bring it now and read it to you—if you would like me to.”

“Please do!” everyone replied. “Do not deprive us of such knowledge for our salvation!”

The Mystery of Salvation as Revealed through Unceasing Prayer

“How can a person be saved?” This is the natural question that arises in the heart of anyone who has glimpsed their own weakness and brokenness, yet still feels the pull of truth and righteousness. When someone has even a small seed of faith in eternal life and turns their eyes toward heaven, they cannot help but wonder about the path to salvation.

Unable to answer on their own, they look to those wiser and more experienced, who point them toward the writings of spiritual teachers. Reading these guides, the seeker finds a consistent message: salvation requires a devout life, the courage to engage in spiritual struggle, and the willingness to lay aside the self. Through this surrender, one learns to live in good works and to keep God’s commandments faithfully—showing a heart that is firm and steadfast in faith.

Then he learns that all these conditions for salvation must be carried out together, and always with deep humility. For just as every virtue leans on the others, so too must they strengthen, refine, and inspire one another. It is like the rays of the sun—only when gathered and focused through glass onto one point do they reveal their power and kindle a flame. Without this focus, they scatter without effect. In the same way, the one who is careless with small things will also stumble in greater ones.

To further impress this truth upon him, he hears praises of the beauty of virtue and stern warnings about the misery of vice. The mind cannot help but remember the promises—of eternal joy for the faithful, and eternal loss for the disobedient.

Such is the way preaching often sounds in our day.

Encouraged by such teaching, the eager seeker gladly sets out to put it into practice, striving to live by all he has read and heard. Yet, very quickly, he finds himself failing. What he had hoped for, and now painfully experiences, is this: his broken and weakened nature has more power over him than the good intentions of his mind. His will is bound, his motives are mixed, and his spiritual strength soon runs dry.

After tasting this helplessness, he begins to wonder if there might be another way—a hidden strength—that could help him live out God’s commandments and the life of true piety, which so many before him had somehow fulfilled.

Seeking peace between his longing for holiness and his inability to reach it, he turns again to the preachers and asks: How can I be saved? How can I make sense of my failure to live as I ought? And—can the one who preaches these things truly live them out himself?

“Ask God! Pray to Him for help!”

So the seeker begins to wonder: would it not be better, from the very beginning—and indeed at every moment—to learn about prayer itself? For prayer is the strength that makes it possible to live a life of piety, and it is the very path toward salvation.

With this thought, he turns to study. He reads about prayer, reflects on it, and searches through the writings of those who have taught about it. And he finds much wisdom: one speaks of the need for prayer, another of its power and benefits, another of the duty to pray. Still others speak of the diligence prayer requires, the attention of mind, the warmth of heart, the need for humility, contrition, reconciliation with others, and purity of thought.

All of this is good and inspiring. Yet he cannot help but ask: What is prayer itself? And how does one actually pray?

Strangely, though these questions are so basic and essential, clear and practical answers are rarely given. And so the seeker remains confused. From all his reading, he remembers mostly the outward expressions of prayer: attending church, making the sign of the cross, bowing to the ground, kneeling, chanting psalms, canons, akathists. These, while holy, are not the heart of prayer itself.

And indeed, this is how prayer is commonly understood by those who do not yet know the writings on inner prayer or the wisdom of the Holy Fathers.

At last, he discovers the *Philokalia*, a treasury in which twenty-five holy teachers reveal the art of true prayer of the heart. Here, at last, the veil begins to lift. He sees that real prayer is to hold the mind and memory steady in the remembrance of God—to walk always in His presence, to stir the heart to love Him by turning thoughts to Him, and to let the name of Jesus be carried on the breath and in the beating of the heart.

And so, prayer is not confined to times or places, nor to postures or rituals alone. It becomes a way of life: the continual calling on the most holy Name of Jesus, the Jesus Prayer, offered unceasingly, everywhere, in all things, and at all times.

These clear truths awaken the seeker’s understanding and open the path for him to learn how to pray rightly. He is eager to begin, and he sets out at once to put these instructions into practice. Yet even with such wisdom before him, he soon finds himself struggling. His prayer is inconsistent, and he falters often.

It is only when an experienced guide, using that same book—the *Philokalia*—steps in to help, that the seeker begins to see more deeply. The guide explains that the heart of the mystery lies not in lofty thoughts or special techniques, but in constancy—unceasing repetition of the prayer, no matter how weakly or imperfectly it begins. This steady rhythm of prayer is the only true path toward the fullness of inner prayer and the salvation of the soul.

Constancy becomes the foundation of everything else. As Saint Simeon the New Theologian declares, “The one who prays unceasingly has gathered everything good into this one work.”

To make this even clearer, the guide begins to unfold the teaching in full:

First of all, true faith is needed for the salvation of the soul. As Scripture says, *without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one without faith stands under judgment.*

And yet, in that same Scripture, it is written that a person cannot produce faith on their own—not even faith the size of a mustard seed. Faith is not born from our efforts, but is itself a gift of God, a grace bestowed by the Holy Spirit.

What then should a person do? How can we hold together our deep need for faith with our inability to create it on our own?

The answer is found in Scripture itself: *Ask, and you will receive.* Even the apostles, on their own, could not stir up perfect faith within themselves. So they turned to Jesus and prayed, “Lord, grant us faith.” Their example makes it clear: faith is received through prayer.

But faith alone is not enough. For the salvation of the soul, good works—acts of love and virtue—are also needed. As the Apostle James reminds us, *faith without works is dead.* And Jesus Himself said, *If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments: Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.* And this is not optional—for whoever fails in even one commandment is guilty of all.

Yet here lies the struggle. Paul, in his deep honesty, admits that though he longs to do good, he finds himself unable. *The law is spiritual, but I am weak and bound by sin. The good I want to do, I cannot carry out; and the evil I do not want to do, that I end up doing. In my heart I love God’s law, yet in my flesh I am captive to the law of sin.*

How then can anyone keep the commandments? How can one walk in God’s way if the will alone is not enough? Paul gives the answer: *you do not have because you do not ask.*

Our weakness is not final—it is only weakness when we do not pray. For Jesus Himself said, *Without Me, you can do nothing.* And again, *Abide in Me, and I in you. Whoever abides in Me will bear much fruit.*

To abide in Him is to remain in His presence—to walk with Him moment by moment—and to ask in His Name without ceasing. For He promised, *If you ask anything in My Name, I will do it.*

Thus it is through prayer that we gain the strength to live in good works. Even the Apostle Paul shows us this: he prayed three times to be freed from temptation; he bowed before the Father asking to be strengthened inwardly; and in the end, he taught that prayer must come first, and that one must pray about everything—unceasingly.

From this, it becomes clear: the salvation of the soul depends on prayer. Prayer is the root and the breath of faith, and through it every virtue takes form. In short, everything can be accomplished through prayer—and without it, no true Christian life is possible.

This is why only prayer is given the command to be constant. Each other virtue has its time, but of prayer it is said: *pray without ceasing.* We are called to pray always, everywhere, in every circumstance.

Yet true prayer is not merely words. It asks for a heart that is pure, a mind that is clear, a spirit that is attentive and aflame with love, filled with humility and awe. And here we must admit, if we are honest: how far we often are from such prayer. So often, we pray out of duty rather than delight, forcing ourselves rather than being carried by love.

Scripture itself tells us that on our own, we cannot clear the mind or purify the heart. *The thoughts of man are evil from his youth.* Only God can give a new heart and create a new spirit within us. Even the will to pray, and the act of praying itself, come from Him.

Paul himself confessed: *My spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.* And again he writes, *We do not know what we should pray for as we ought.*

From this we see: left to ourselves, we cannot even grasp the very essence of true prayer.

Faced with such helplessness, what remains within a person’s own will? What strength does one truly have to save the soul? He cannot bring about faith by himself, nor good works, nor even true prayer. What, then, is left? What power belongs to his free will so that he might not perish, but live?

Here is the mystery: since every action has its own essence, the Lord has kept the essence of prayer for Himself, giving it as a gift of grace when He wills. Yet, to show that we depend on Him entirely, He has left to us the *quantity* of prayer—the practice of praying unceasingly. He has commanded us to pray always, everywhere, and at all times. In this command is hidden the path: through constancy in prayer, the soul is led into true prayer, and with it comes faith, the keeping of God’s commandments, and salvation itself.

The Fathers of the Church speak clearly on this. Saint Macarius the Great says: *To pray in any manner, so long as it is constant, is within our power; but true prayer is a gift of grace.* Hesychius teaches that constancy in prayer becomes a habit, and habit turns into second nature—so much so that the heart cannot be cleansed apart from the continual calling on the Name of Jesus.

Callistus and Ignatius counsel that before any ascetic struggle or act of virtue, one should begin with unceasing prayer in the Name of Christ. For even an impure prayer, when offered with constancy, is purified by its very persistence. Blessed Diadochus adds that if one were to call on God’s Name continually, he would not fall into sin.

How wise and practical are these words of the Fathers! Their teaching is simple, flowing from their lived experience, and it shines like a lamp upon the way of the soul.

How different their words sound from the reasoning of mere moral philosophy! Human reason says: Do this or that; strengthen your will; fight for virtue; cleanse your thoughts of distraction and fill them with noble ideas; live well, and you will be respected, and your conscience will be at peace.

But alas—how often even our best efforts fall short! For without the constancy of prayer, and without the help of God that prayer calls down, all such striving remains powerless.

Let us listen again to the Fathers and see what they teach about the purification of the soul.

Saint John of the Ladder writes, *When the soul is darkened by unclean thoughts, strike your enemies with the Name of Jesus, repeating it constantly. You will find no stronger weapon in heaven or on earth.*

Saint Gregory of Sinai teaches, *Know that no man is able to master his own mind. But when unclean thoughts appear, call upon the Name of Jesus Christ with greater frequency, and the thoughts will quiet themselves.*

What a simple and mercifully accessible method this is—and how proven by experience! And how different it is from the advice of reason alone, which demands purity through sheer effort of will.

So then, from the lived teaching of the holy Fathers, we can reach this firm conclusion: the most direct, the most reliable, and the most accessible way toward salvation and perfection of soul is found in the *frequency* of prayer—the steady, unbroken rhythm of calling on the Lord, even if our prayer feels weak.

O Christian soul! If you do not yet feel within yourself the ability to worship God in spirit and in truth… if your heart has not yet tasted the warmth and sweetness of inward prayer—then still, do not despair. Offer what you *can*. Give to God what lies within your reach. Begin with your lips. Let them form the prayer, however simple, however small. Let them accustom themselves to the continual calling on the mighty Name of Jesus Christ.

This is not beyond anyone. It asks for no great strength, only persistence. And through it, the promise of Scripture comes alive: *Let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God—that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His Name.*

The constancy of prayer will eventually become a habit, a natural part of life. Over time, it shapes the mind and heart in the right way. Imagine if a person were to faithfully keep just this one commandment—praying without ceasing. In this single act, he would fulfill all the commandments.

If he called on the Name of Jesus constantly, in the secret place of his heart, at all times and through all activities—even at first without warmth or zeal, even by sheer effort of will—there would be no room for sinful pleasures. Every wandering or impure thought would meet resistance before it could take root, and no sinful act would seem appealing, as it might to an idle mind. Idle chatter would fade, and the grace contained in the Name of God, invoked continually, would quickly erase each transgression.

Through constant prayer, the soul is drawn away from sin and toward what is most important of all—union with God. This is why quantity matters so deeply in prayer. Unceasing prayer is the surest way to reach true, pure prayer. It is the most reliable path to prepare the heart, to achieve the goal of prayer, and to draw closer to salvation.

To deepen your understanding of the power and necessity of constant prayer, consider this: first, every stirring in your heart, every thought of prayer, comes from the Holy Spirit and the voice of your guardian angel. Second, the Name of Jesus itself, when called upon, carries its own living, active power. And third, do not be discouraged by the dryness or weakness of your prayers—patiently continue, trusting that the fruits of calling on God’s Name will come in their own time.

Do not heed the idle suggestions of the world, which claims that a single, simple, persistent prayer is too small or too long-winded to matter. The truth is, the power of God’s Name and your faithful repetition of it will bear fruit, in its own way, in its own time.

One spiritual writer expresses this beautifully: he says that many so-called wise people, who seek grandeur and act according to the proud reasoning of the world, look down on the simple, constant practice of prayer. They consider it insignificant, even trivial. But how mistaken they are! They forget what Jesus taught: *Unless you become like little children, you will by no means enter the Kingdom of God.*

They invent complicated methods and rely on reason, yet what does it really take to say with a sincere heart, *“Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me”?* This simple, steady prayer is exactly what Christ praised. Even miracles were wrought through such brief but constant invocations of His Name.

O Christian soul, take heart! Do not hold back the steady cry of your prayers. Even if your prayer rises from a heart still distracted, still touched by worldly concerns, do not worry. Simply continue. Do not give up, do not be afraid—for prayer itself is purified through persistence. Remember: “He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world” (1 John 4:4). God is greater than your heart, and He knows everything, as the Apostle reminds us.

So, with this in mind—since unceasing prayer is powerful despite human weakness, and always within reach—decide to spend just one day watching over yourself and praying without ceasing. Let the name of Jesus Christ fill more of your day than anything else. By giving prayer the first place over worldly matters, you will see that your day was not wasted but used for your salvation. On God’s scales of justice, such prayer outweighs all weakness and sin, wiping away the sins of that day from the book of life. It sets you on the path of righteousness and gives you hope of receiving light even in eternity.

**Pilgrim:** I thank you with all my heart, Father! You have filled my soul with joy through this reading. For the Lord’s sake, and with your blessing, please allow me to copy this manuscript for myself—I could do it in just a few hours. What you read is so beautiful and so comforting, and it is as clear to me as the writings of the Holy Fathers in the Philokalia. For example, John of Karpathos in the fourth part says that if you lack the strength for strict fasting or great ascetic struggles, remember that the Lord still desires to save you through prayer. And here in this manuscript, it is expressed so simply and clearly. I first thank God, and then you, for the gift of hearing it!

**Professor:** “Most honorable Father, I also listened with great pleasure and attention to your reading. By the highest reasoning, everything you said is true, and I find it deeply moving. Yet, it seems to me that unceasing prayer depends on having the right conditions—quiet and solitude. I agree that constant prayer is powerful, that it is the true way to receive grace in all good works and to bring light to the soul, and that it is possible for people to practice. But I believe this can only really be done when a person has the chance for peace and stillness. When there are no duties, no pressing cares, no distractions, then one can pray without ceasing. The only struggles then are against laziness or wandering thoughts. But if a person is weighed down with constant responsibilities, with matters that demand attention, and if they must live in the noisy company of others, then—even if they have a strong desire to pray constantly—it seems impossible because of these unavoidable interruptions. Therefore, I think that a method of unceasing prayer that depends on solitude cannot be available to all, and was not intended for everyone.”

**Elder:** “Ah, what an unfortunate conclusion! Leaving aside the fact that a heart trained in inner prayer can call upon God without hindrance in any kind of activity, whether work or thought, and in any noisy surroundings—(those who have practiced this know it well; those who have not must be taught step by step)—we can say for certain that nothing outside of us can interrupt the prayer of someone who truly desires to pray. For our innermost thoughts are free, not chained by anything external, and are always within reach, always able to be turned toward prayer. Even the lips can whisper the words of prayer silently, while among others or while busy with work. And honestly, our tasks are not so important, nor our conversations so weighty, that we cannot find at least a little space to call on the Name of Jesus again and again. Even if the mind has not yet learned the full habit of unceasing prayer, we can still begin. Of course, solitude and freedom from distractions are the best setting for deep, attentive prayer. But if we cannot have that, we must not use it as an excuse to abandon constant prayer. Both constancy and frequency are within everyone’s reach—whether strong or weak—and they lie within the power of our will.”

This has been shown again and again by people carrying heavy responsibilities, burdens, cares, and endless work. Not only did they continually call on the name of Jesus Christ, but through this they learned and came to know the unceasing prayer of the heart.

One such example is Patriarch Photius. Raised from senator to patriarch, while guiding the vast church of Constantinople, he never ceased calling on the name of God—and through this he even came to the self-moving prayer of the heart. Callistus of holy Mount Athos found the same gift, learning unceasing prayer while working in the busy and distracting service of the monastery kitchen. And Lazarus, a simple-hearted man weighed down with unending tasks for the brethren, prayed the Jesus Prayer in the midst of his noisy work and was strengthened by it. So it was with many others who practiced the continual calling on God’s name. If it were truly impossible to pray amid distraction and work, then surely it would never have been commanded.

Saint John Chrysostom, the Golden-Mouthed, says this in his teaching on prayer: “No one should say that it is impossible for a person caught up in worldly affairs, or one who cannot come to church, to pray always. Wherever you are, you can offer sacrifice to God in your heart through prayer. You can pray in the marketplace, while traveling, while selling goods, while working at your trade—anywhere, everywhere. If only a person would keep watch over himself, and become convinced that prayer must be the chief work among all his duties, he would find it natural to pray anywhere.

“He would set his affairs in order with more purpose, speak with others only as needed, keep silence, and avoid empty talk. He would not be crushed by worries and cares, and so would make more room for prayer in quietness. Once prayer becomes his aim, the power of calling on the name of God would crown all his work with blessing. In the end, he would train himself to invoke the name of Jesus Christ unceasingly. Then, through experience, he would discover that constant prayer is indeed within human strength and will—that one can pray at all times, in all places, in every circumstance. And that from spoken prayer one may easily pass into prayer of the mind, and from the mind into prayer of the heart, which opens within us the very Kingdom of God.”

**Professor:** “I agree that during routine tasks it’s possible, even convenient, to pray constantly, since they don’t demand much concentration and allow the mind to sink into unceasing prayer while the lips recite it. But when something requires real focus—like careful reading, deep thinking, or writing—how can I do both at once? Since prayer is mainly an act of the mind, how can one single mind be fully engaged in two things at the same time?”

**Skhimnik:** “The answer is actually quite simple if we remember that people who pray without ceasing fall into three groups: beginners, those still growing, and those who are already skilled in prayer. Even beginners, while their minds are busy with something else, sometimes feel their hearts being drawn to God, and they can still whisper a short prayer constantly—though usually only for short stretches.

Those who are growing, and especially those who have gained the habit of prayer as a natural state of mind, can be writing or reflecting deeply and yet remain always aware of God’s presence. And that awareness itself is the essence of prayer.

Think of it this way: imagine a stern king commands you to write a difficult treatise while standing before his throne. No matter how focused you are on the writing, you cannot forget—even for a moment—that the king is right there, watching, with power over your very life. That constant awareness of his presence shapes everything you do. In the same way, a steady awareness of God’s nearness makes unceasing inner prayer possible, even during demanding mental work.

And for those who have advanced from the prayer of the mind to the prayer of the heart—whether through long practice or by God’s mercy—prayer flows without ceasing, even in sleep. The Scripture bears witness: ‘I sleep, but my heart is awake.’ In such people, the heart itself has learned to call on the Name of God, stirring the mind and the whole soul into an unending stream of prayer, no matter what else they may be doing.”

**Priest:** “Venerable Father, may I share my thoughts? The article you read says beautifully that the only path to salvation and perfection is constant prayer—‘however it may sound.’ But I find this difficult to understand. What is the point of always praying, of calling on the Name of God with my lips, if my mind is not attentive and I don’t even grasp what I am saying? Wouldn’t that be just empty words? In that case, my tongue would be worn out, and my mind—resisting with its own thoughts—would only become more troubled.

God does not ask for words alone. He asks for an attentive mind and a pure heart. Would it not be better to pray less often—perhaps only at set times—and to pray briefly but with focus, warmth, and understanding? Otherwise, you could spend day and night saying prayers, but without a pure heart and good works, it would not bring you any closer to salvation. If it becomes only meaningless repetition, you’ll end up exhausted, discouraged, and ready to give up prayer altogether.

Even Scripture itself warns us about this. For instance: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me’. Or again: ‘Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven’. And also: ‘I would rather speak five words with understanding than ten thousand words in a tongue’. All of this shows that inattentive, verbal prayer is of no use.”

**Skhimnik:** “Your concern would be valid, if not for something important: the guidance given about verbal prayer is that it must be constant and regular. Prayer in the Name of Jesus Christ carries its own inner power, and attention and warmth of spirit are slowly gained through the practice itself. That is why, when the matter is one of frequency, duration, and perseverance in prayer—even if at first it seems dry or distracted—your conclusion does not quite stand.”

Let’s look at this more closely. After defending the great benefits and rich results of constant prayer—prayer that uses the same words again and again—one spiritual writer says:

“Many people who think themselves wise dismiss the steady repetition of a single prayer. They call it useless, trivial, mechanical, or even mindless—fit only for simple folk. But what they don’t understand is the mystery hidden inside this practice. They don’t see how the outward, steady reciting of words quietly joins itself to the true cry of the heart. They don’t realize how it sinks deep into the inner person, until prayer becomes sweet and natural to the soul—like breathing. It nourishes, enlightens, and draws the soul into union with God.

To me, these critics are like children learning their letters. At first they grow bored and complain: ‘Wouldn’t it be better to go fishing, like our fathers, instead of chanting ABC over and over or scribbling on paper with a quill?’ But the value of reading, which can only come through that boring repetition of letters, is hidden from them.

In the same way, the simple but steady calling on God’s Name is a hidden treasure to those who lack experience and trust in its great fruits. They rely only on shallow reasoning, forgetting that a human being is made up of both body and spirit.

Think about it: when you want to purify your soul, don’t you begin by disciplining your body? You fast and give up food that strengthens or stimulates you. Why? Not because the body itself is evil, but so it won’t interfere with—and even more, so it will help—the work of purifying your soul and enlightening your mind. The constant feeling of hunger becomes a reminder of your resolve to seek inner growth and spiritual practices that otherwise slip so easily from memory.

And experience shows you this: through bodily fasting, your mind becomes clearer, your heart more peaceful, your passions more subdued, and you are gently urged to continue your spiritual work. In this way, outer practices lead to inner benefits.”

Understand this: the same principle applies to unceasing, steady prayer spoken with the lips. Over time, that simple verbal repetition blossoms into true interior prayer of the heart. It gently leads the mind toward union with God.

Some people think that constant repetition tires the tongue, or that boredom from repeating words without feeling proves the practice is useless. But experience shows the opposite.

Those who commit to always calling on the Name of Jesus—or praying the Jesus Prayer without ceasing—do face difficulty at first. They feel resistance, laziness, even frustration. But if they keep going, something remarkable happens. Slowly and almost without noticing, the prayer begins to carry itself. The mouth and lips take on the work as if by their own power. The words flow naturally, with no strain, and sometimes even in silence.

The very muscles of the throat seem to adapt, so that the act of praying feels as if it has always belonged to you—like breathing. And when you stop, you feel a lack inside, as if something essential were missing.

At that point, the mind yields and begins to listen to this quiet, involuntary recitation. It gives its full attention, and from that listening springs sweetness in the heart—the true prayer of the heart.

This is the genuine fruit of unceasing prayer. And it is the very opposite of what critics imagine when they judge without having tasted its reality.

Regarding the passages from Scripture you mentioned, a closer look makes their meaning clear. Jesus condemned hypocritical worship—those who shouted “Lord, Lord!” while their hearts remained far from God—because the Pharisees showed faith only with their lips and not through their actions or inner devotion. That criticism was aimed at them, not at sincere prayer. Christ’s teaching on prayer is direct: we are meant to pray always and not grow discouraged. Likewise, the Apostle Paul values a few meaningful words spoken with understanding far more than a multitude of empty words spoken thoughtlessly, even in foreign tongues. His guidance applies to prayer as well: “I desire that men pray everywhere” \[I Tim. 2:8] and, in general, “Pray without ceasing” \[I Thess. 5:17]. Now you can see how powerful constant prayer is in its simplicity—and how careful we must be in reading Scripture rightly.

That is so true! I’ve seen many people practicing the unceasing Jesus Prayer on their own, without guidance and without fully grasping the need for attentiveness. And yet, over time, their mouths and tongues could not help but keep reciting the prayer, bringing them delight, illumination, and transforming them from weak, careless individuals into steadfast ascetics and champions of virtue.

**Skhimnik:** “Yes! Prayer has the power to make a person feel reborn. Its strength is such that even the fiercest passions cannot resist it. If you like, friends, before we part, I can share a short but insightful piece I brought with me.”

**Everyone:** “We would love to hear it!”

**Skhimnik:** On the Power of Prayer

“Prayer is so powerful and alive that you can continue with your daily activities, and yet it will guide you to act rightly and justly.

“All that God requires is love—love, and then do as you wish, says the blessed Augustine, for one who truly loves cannot desire to harm the beloved. Since prayer is the expression and work of love, we can also say this: nothing more is needed for salvation than unceasing prayer. Pray, and act as you will, and you will fulfill the purpose of prayer and gain illumination through it.

“To make this clearer, let’s consider some examples:

(1) Pray and entertain any thoughts you have, and prayer will purify them. It will illuminate your mind and quiet or remove all inappropriate thoughts. Saint Gregory of Sinai advises, ‘If you wish to drive away thoughts and purify your mind, drive them away with prayer; for only prayer can control thoughts.’ Saint John of the Ladder says similarly, ‘Banish hostile thoughts with the Name of Jesus; you will find no other weapon than this.’”

(2) Pray, and live as you will, and your actions will be pleasing to God, bringing both benefit and redemption to you.

No prayer is ever empty, no matter how weak or distracted it may seem, because within it lies the power of grace. “Holy is His name… and everyone who calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved” \[Acts 2:21].

For example, there was someone who prayed without much devotion and with no apparent result. Yet through that prayer, light came, leading to repentance. Or consider an unmarried woman, once living carelessly—she began to pray, and through prayer she found the path to chastity and obedience to Christ’s teaching.

(3) Pray, and do not strain yourself in your own struggle against the passions. Prayer will overcome them within you. As Scripture says, “He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world” \[1 John 4:4]. Saint John of Karpathos adds, if you do not yet have the strength of abstinence, do not be distressed—God asks only for diligence in prayer, and prayer itself will save you.

We see this in the story of a holy elder in the *Lives of the Fathers*. He could not overcome his weakness and fell into sin, yet he did not despair. Instead, he turned again to prayer, and it restored his inner peace.

(4) Pray, and be free from anxiety. Do not fear misfortune or calamity, for prayer will shield you and drive them away. Remember Peter, sinking in the waves, rescued through prayer; Paul praying in prison; the monk delivered from temptation through prayer; the young woman saved by prayer from an attacker. Stories like these show the power, the strength, and the boundless reach of prayer in the Name of Jesus Christ.

(5) Pray always, in whatever way you can, and let nothing trouble you. Keep joy in your heart and peace in your soul, for prayer will guide you and teach you. Remember the words of the saints—John Chrysostom said, “Even if we pray while still burdened by sin, prayer immediately begins to cleanse us.” And Saint Mark the Ascetic said, “Even the smallest prayer is within our reach, but pure prayer is the gift of grace.” So, give what you can to God. Offer the prayers that are possible for you, and His strength will meet your weakness. Even prayer that feels dry and distracted, if offered faithfully and often until it becomes like second nature, will gradually be transformed into pure, bright, fervent, and life-giving prayer.

(6) And finally, when your spiritual efforts are carried along with prayer, you will find there is no time left—not only to commit sin, but not even to think about it.

Do you see now how much wisdom is contained in the simple saying: “Love, and do what you will. Pray, and do what you will”? What comfort this brings to a weary sinner weighed down by weakness, to the one who sighs under the heavy struggle of inner battles!

Prayer—this is the gift given to us as the all-embracing path to salvation and the perfecting of the soul. This is certain! But prayer also carries its own condition: God has commanded us to “pray without ceasing.” It follows, then, that prayer shows its full power and bears fruit only when it is constant and unbroken. For while the practice of constant prayer is within our reach, the purity, fire, and perfection of prayer are the gifts of grace.

So let us pray as much as possible. Let us dedicate our whole lives to prayer—even if, at first, our prayer is distracted. Prayer offered often will teach us to be attentive, and the habit of quantity will, in time, blossom into quality. As one wise teacher once said: to learn to do anything well, one must do it often.

**Professor:** “Prayer is truly a great gift! And the desire to pray without ceasing is the very key that opens up its treasures. Yet so often I find myself caught between eagerness and laziness. I long to find the means and the strength to overcome this weakness, to gain conviction, and to stir myself to steady, constant prayer.”

**Skhimnik:** “Many spiritual teachers give us different helps, grounded in good sense, to encourage faithfulness in prayer. For example, they suggest:

1. To think deeply about how necessary, how excellent, and how beneficial prayer is for the salvation of our souls.
2. To be convinced that God Himself asks us to pray, and that His command is heard everywhere.
3. To remember always that laziness and carelessness in prayer will not lead to success in doing good or finding peace and salvation, but will surely bring sorrow in this life and suffering in eternity.
4. To strengthen our will by looking at the examples of God’s saints, who all found light and salvation through unceasing prayer.

“All of these counsels are true and valuable. But still, a careless and self-indulgent soul often finds little power in them. They seem bitter to its spoiled taste, and too weak for its wounded nature. For what Christian does not already know that we are called to constant and faithful prayer? That God requires it? That neglect will bring loss and sorrow? And that the saints themselves found joy and holiness through tireless prayer? Yet this knowledge so seldom bears fruit! Each of us knows, deep down, how rarely our reason and conscience are matched by our actions. And because we fail to remember this, we go on living in weakness and idleness.”

This is why the Holy Fathers, full of wisdom and experience, gave so much attention to this matter. They knew well the weakness of the human will and how easily the heart can be drawn into distraction and desire. Like skilled doctors who cover a bitter medicine with honey to make it easier to take, they offered the simplest and most reliable practices—always rooted in hope and in God’s help—to overcome laziness in prayer and to guide us toward perfection and joyful trust through loving communion with God.

They encourage us to often reflect on the state of our soul and to read carefully what the Fathers have written about prayer. With confidence they assure us how simple and attainable these inner experiences can be: the sweetness that rises from the heart, a gentle warmth and light shining from within, a joy that cannot be described, freedom of spirit, deep peace, overflowing happiness, and a sense of contentment in life—all of these are gifts that come through the prayer of the heart.

When a person contemplates these things, even a weary or indifferent soul is warmed and strengthened, stirred with courage to believe it can truly pray. It is drawn, almost enticed, into the practice itself. Saint Isaac the Syrian speaks of this when he says, “The soul is lured on by joy, born of hope that blossoms in the heart. The heart flourishes when it reflects on this hope and trust.” He also writes, “From beginning to end in this exercise, one leans on hope and trusts that there is a way to succeed. This very hope sets a goal before the mind, and the mind finds comfort in pursuing it.”

In speaking about laziness as a great obstacle to prayer and the need to rekindle one’s zeal, the venerable Hesychius says plainly, “We seek the inner stillness of the heart for no other reason than the sweet consolation and joy it brings to the soul.”

So then, this Father teaches that the motivation for prayer should be “its gentle comfort and joy.” In the same way, Saint Makarios the Great says that we should take on our spiritual practice of prayer with the hope of experiencing its fruit— the joy and delight that fills the heart.

The Philokalia is full of examples of this—rich descriptions of the sweetness of prayer and the inner peace it brings. Someone who struggles with laziness or dryness in prayer should read these passages often. At the same time, they must remember their own unworthiness and continually humble themselves for their lack of zeal in prayer.

**Priest:** “But wouldn’t this line of thinking lead a beginner into what theologians call ‘spiritual gluttony’? That restless hunger of the soul that craves excessive comfort and spiritual gifts, instead of simply doing good works out of obedience and duty, without expectation of reward?”

**Professor:** “I think what the theologians warn against here is excess—desiring consolations too greedily. But they don’t forbid us from seeking sweetness in prayer or consolation while practicing the virtues. It’s true that longing for reward isn’t a mark of perfection, but God Himself doesn’t forbid us from looking toward reward and comfort as encouragement. In fact, He often frames His commandments with the promise of reward.

For example, ‘Honor your father and your mother’—a clear commandment—comes with a promise to encourage its keeping: ‘that it may go well with you’ \[Deut. 5:16]. Or take these words of Jesus: ‘If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor’—perfection itself is commanded, and yet even here a reward follows: ‘and you will have treasure in heaven’ \[Matt. 19:21].”

“Blessed are you on the day when people hate you, when they cast out your name as evil because of the Son of Man” \[Luke 6:22]. This is a call to a heroic act, one that demands extraordinary strength of spirit and unshakable patience. And for this reason, great rewards and consolations are promised—rewards strong enough to stir and sustain that kind of strength: “for great is your reward in heaven” \[Luke 6:23]. That’s why I believe that a longing for the sweet consolations found in the prayer of the heart is necessary. It becomes the very means by which diligence and power in prayer are born. All of this, without question, confirms the reflections we just heard from Father Skhimnik.

**Skhimnik:** “Saint Macarius of Egypt, one of the great teachers, speaks very clearly about this. He says: just as when planting a vineyard, all the effort and labor mean nothing if no fruit grows, so it is with prayer. If you do not find within yourself the fruit of the Spirit—love, peace, joy, and the like—then all your labor has been in vain. That is why we must practice prayer with the aim, or at least the hope, of receiving its fruit: the delight of sweet consolation in our hearts.”

Do you see how clearly this Holy Father settles the question of whether consolations are needed in prayer? … It reminds me of something I recently read from another spiritual writer about the very reason man is drawn to pour himself out in prayer—it is natural to him. And because prayer springs from our very nature, reflecting on this inner impulse can itself become a powerful way of stirring up diligence in prayer—the very thing our professor here longs to find.

Let me summarize briefly what stood out to me from that article. The writer explained that both reason and nature lead a person to the knowledge of God. Reason argues that there can be no action without a cause, and as it climbs upward from lower causes to higher, it finally reaches the First Cause—God Himself. Nature, for its part, reveals everywhere a marvelous wisdom, harmony, and order, a gradual unfolding that forms a ladder from the finite to the infinite. In this way, even a natural man can arrive at a sense of God.

That is why, in all of history, there has never been a nation nor even the most primitive tribe that lacked some concept of God. Because of this, even the most uncultured islander instinctively lifts his eyes to heaven. Without anyone teaching him, he falls to his knees and lets out a sigh—a sigh that is mysterious, yet deeply natural. In that moment, he feels something draw him upward, something within him reaching toward the unknown. From this root, all natural religions have sprung. And what is most remarkable is that everywhere, at the heart of these religions, prayer appears as their essence and soul—though often clothed in external rites, sacrifices, or practices, sometimes distorted by the ignorance of undeveloped peoples.

And the more we observe this universal phenomenon, the more strongly we are compelled to seek the mystery behind it—this inborn inclination of the human soul to pray.

Psychology offers a straightforward explanation: the source, guiding force, and energy behind all human passions and actions is an innate love of self. The universal drive for self-preservation confirms this. Every desire, effort, and action ultimately seeks to satisfy this love of self and pursue personal gain. Yet the human spirit cannot find fulfillment in anything purely tangible, and self-love never strays from its aim. Desires deepen, the search for personal gain intensifies, and imagination and emotion become swept up in this drive.

These inner stirrings and the self-directed longing they create naturally push a person toward prayer. They are the calls of self-love, striving to achieve its aims, often with great difficulty. The less a person succeeds, the more focused he becomes on personal gain, and the more passionately this longing pours out in prayer, appealing to the Unknown Source of All Being to satisfy it. In this way, self-love—the very core of life—is the fundamental spark that draws natural man to pray.

The all-wise Creator built this capacity for self-love into human nature precisely as a means, as the Fathers describe it, to entice and lift fallen humanity toward heavenly communion.

Oh, if only people did not distort this capacity, if only they preserved its true purpose for their spiritual life! Then they would carry within themselves the powerful encouragement and resources needed on the path toward moral perfection. But, alas, all too often, this noble capacity is twisted into the corrupt passion of selfishness, turning it into a tool of the lower nature.

My dearest visitors, I thank you from the bottom of my heart! Your discussions, so redemptive for my soul, have delighted me deeply and been most instructive for someone as inexperienced as I am. May the Lord reward you with His grace for your edifying love.

All present bid their farewells.
