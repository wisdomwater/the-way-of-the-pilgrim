# Chapter 6

> *“Brother helped by brother is like a city, strong and tall; it is fortified as a firmly established kingdom.”
—PROV. 18:19*

**Pilgrim:** As I promised when I saw you yesterday, I brought along my esteemed traveling companion—the man whose bright conversation made the road more pleasant, and whom you said you wanted to meet.

**Starets:** I am very glad to see both of you, and I hope my honored guests share that joy. It is a blessing to hear of your experiences. These are my guests: a venerable skhimnik and a Reverend Father. Where two or three are gathered in the name of Jesus Christ, He promised to be present; now that five of us are gathered in His Name, His grace will surely be poured out even more abundantly.

Good friend, the story your traveling companion told me yesterday about your deep devotion to the Holy Gospel was remarkable and enlightening. I would be glad to hear how this devout mystery was revealed to you.

**Professor:** In His great mercy, the abundantly loving Lord—who desires that all be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth—revealed this knowledge to me in a wondrous way, without any human intervention. I was a professor at the Lyceum\* for five years, living a degraded life, swept away by empty secular philosophies rather than by Christ. I might have utterly perished if not for the steady, godly influence of my devout mother and my sister, a serious, unmarried young woman with whom I lived...

“One day, while walking along the main boulevard, I met an extraordinary young man. He told me he was French, well-educated, and had just arrived from Paris in search of a tutoring position. I was impressed by his refinement and his high level of learning. Since he was new in town, I invited him to my home, and we quickly became friends.

For about two months, he often visited me, and sometimes we went out together—seeking amusements and visiting places that, as you can imagine, were not known for their moral atmosphere.

One day, he invited me to join him at such a place, trying to entice me by describing its “special attractions.” But in the middle of his lively description, he suddenly stopped and asked if we could leave my study, where we were sitting, and go to the drawing room.

This struck me as odd. I told him I had noticed before that he seemed reluctant to stay in my study, and I asked him why. I also wanted to keep him there, since the drawing room was next to my mother’s and sister’s rooms, and it would have been inappropriate to have such a conversation within earshot of them.

He tried to offer various excuses, until at last he admitted honestly: “Among the other books on your shelf, I see a New Testament. I respect it so much that I find it difficult to speak of immoral things in its presence. Please, take it out of here, and then we can talk freely.”

Foolishly, I laughed and said, “You should have told me sooner!” I took the New Testament from the shelf, handed it to him, and added, “Here, you put it in the other room.”

The moment the Holy Book touched his hands, he began to tremble violently—and in an instant, he vanished.

I was struck with such horror that I collapsed to the floor in a dead faint. The servants, hearing the commotion, rushed in and tried for half an hour to revive me. When at last I regained consciousness, I was seized with an indescribable fear. My whole body trembled, my hands and feet were numb, and I could not move them. A doctor was called, and he declared that I was suffering from paralysis brought on by a sudden and powerful shock.

“For an entire year after this strange incident—and despite the devoted care of many skilled physicians—I lay bedridden, with no relief in sight. In time, I was forced to resign from my teaching post. My dear, elderly mother passed away during this period, and my sister resolved to enter a monastery. All these sorrows only deepened the weight of my illness.

The only light in those dark days was the New Testament. From the very first moments of my sickness, it had never left my hands. It became both my comfort and my constant reminder of that extraordinary event.

One day, a hermit whom I had never met before appeared at my door, collecting alms for his cloister. He spoke to me gently but firmly, urging me not to rely solely on medicine—“for medicines have no power without the help of God,” he said. “Ask God, and pray diligently, for prayer is the strongest remedy for every illness, both of body and of soul.”

I protested in confusion: “But how can I pray in this state? I can’t even make a single prostration or raise my hand to bless myself with the sign of the cross!”

“At least try to pray somehow,” he replied simply. He offered no further explanation, and soon departed.

Yet his words lingered. My mind began to dwell on prayer—its meaning, its power, its fruits—and I recalled, almost as if by providence, the theology lectures I had once heard as a student. The memory of those spiritual truths warmed my heart. At once, I felt a faint easing of my illness.

The New Testament lay at my side, and since that miraculous encounter I had held a firm faith in its words. I remembered, too, that all those lectures I had heard about prayer were drawn entirely from its pages. It seemed clear to me that the best way to learn about prayer—and about Christian piety itself—was to go straight to the source.

So I began to read the New Testament slowly, carefully, attentively—turning it into a deep and abundant spring from which I drew understanding of the full path to salvation and the true way of interior prayer. I marked every passage that touched on the subject. From that day forward, I have tried to study these divine teachings regularly and to put them into practice as best I can, though not without struggle.

And as I did so, my illness gradually lessened—until at last, as you see now, I was completely restored. Alone in the world, I resolved that in gratitude for God’s fatherly mercy—for His healing and His guidance—I would follow my sister’s example and the call of my own soul. I would consecrate myself to an ascetic life, so that, free from worldly hindrance, I might seek and embrace those sweet words of eternal life which the Scriptures had so generously revealed to me.”

“So now,” the professor continued, “I am making my way toward the secluded skete at the Solovets Monastery by the White Sea—the one called Anzerskiy—which I have heard from a most trustworthy source is perfectly suited for the contemplative life.

I’ll tell you frankly: While the holy New Testament has been my constant comfort on the road, illuminating my still-unripe mind and even warming my cold heart, I cannot hide from you the truth of my weakness. I am afraid—afraid because my heart is both frail and damaged, and because the Gospel sets before us such great demands for doing good works and attaining salvation. It calls for complete self-denial, for tireless spiritual struggle, for a humility deeper than I can yet fathom. And so, I stand between despair and hope… and I do not know what will become of me.”

The skhimnik looked at him earnestly and replied,

“After such a clear and miraculous sign of God’s mercy toward you—and with your level of learning—it is not only wrong but utterly inexcusable for you to give in to despair, or even allow the faintest shadow of doubt to enter your heart about God’s providence and help!

Do you know what the holy ‘Golden-Mouth’—St. John Chrysostom, enlightened by God—teaches about this? He says: *‘No one should ever despair, nor imagine the Gospel commandments to be unattainable or impossible to fulfill! For when God appointed the path for man’s salvation, He did not set down commandments so hard that man would be driven to sin. No! Rather, they were given so that, through their holiness and their life-giving necessity, we might be blessed both in this present life and in eternity.’*”

The skhimnik nodded, his eyes warm but serious.

“Of course,” he said, “to our fallen nature, the steadfast and constant keeping of God’s commandments feels impossibly hard, and so salvation itself may seem out of reach. But the same divine Word that gave us these commandments also gave us the means—not only to fulfill them with ease, but to find consolation in fulfilling them.

“If at first this truth is hidden from you, that is no accident. It is meant to lead the beginner into deeper humility, and to draw him more closely to God, teaching him that his safest refuge is not in his own strength, but in prayer—in calling on His Fatherly help. That is where the mystery of salvation lies—not in trusting our own willpower, but in relying entirely on Him.”

The pilgrim’s face lit up with longing.

“Weak and powerless as I am,” he said, “how I wish I could know this mystery well enough to put it to use—to stir my lazy soul, even a little, toward the glory of God and my salvation!”

The skhimnik smiled gently.

“But you do know it, dear brother,” he replied. “You’ve learned it already from your *Philokalia*. It is the mystery of unceasing prayer—that very prayer you have come to know so well, that you practice so fervently, and that you find so much comfort in.”

The pilgrim bowed his head.

“Reverend Father,” he said with emotion, “for the love of God, let me hear it from your own lips. Speak to me of this mystery of salvation and of this holy prayer, which more than anything else I hunger to hear about, and love to read of—for it strengthens and comforts my poor, sinful soul.”

Although I cannot share much from my own experience about this beautiful spiritual practice, I do have a very helpful work written by a wise spiritual teacher on this very subject. If it pleases you all, I can bring it now and read it to you—if you would like me to.”

“Please do!” everyone replied. “Do not deprive us of such knowledge for our salvation!”

The Mystery of Salvation as Revealed through Unceasing Prayer

“How can a person be saved?” This is the natural question that arises in the heart of anyone who has glimpsed their own weakness and brokenness, yet still feels the pull of truth and righteousness. When someone has even a small seed of faith in eternal life and turns their eyes toward heaven, they cannot help but wonder about the path to salvation.

Unable to answer on their own, they look to those wiser and more experienced, who point them toward the writings of spiritual teachers. Reading these guides, the seeker finds a consistent message: salvation requires a devout life, the courage to engage in spiritual struggle, and the willingness to lay aside the self. Through this surrender, one learns to live in good works and to keep God’s commandments faithfully—showing a heart that is firm and steadfast in faith.

Then he learns that all these conditions for salvation must be carried out together, and always with deep humility. For just as every virtue leans on the others, so too must they strengthen, refine, and inspire one another. It is like the rays of the sun—only when gathered and focused through glass onto one point do they reveal their power and kindle a flame. Without this focus, they scatter without effect. In the same way, the one who is careless with small things will also stumble in greater ones.

To further impress this truth upon him, he hears praises of the beauty of virtue and stern warnings about the misery of vice. The mind cannot help but remember the promises—of eternal joy for the faithful, and eternal loss for the disobedient.

Such is the way preaching often sounds in our day.

Encouraged by such teaching, the eager seeker gladly sets out to put it into practice, striving to live by all he has read and heard. Yet, very quickly, he finds himself failing. What he had hoped for, and now painfully experiences, is this: his broken and weakened nature has more power over him than the good intentions of his mind. His will is bound, his motives are mixed, and his spiritual strength soon runs dry.

After tasting this helplessness, he begins to wonder if there might be another way—a hidden strength—that could help him live out God’s commandments and the life of true piety, which so many before him had somehow fulfilled.

Seeking peace between his longing for holiness and his inability to reach it, he turns again to the preachers and asks: How can I be saved? How can I make sense of my failure to live as I ought? And—can the one who preaches these things truly live them out himself?

“Ask God! Pray to Him for help!”

So the seeker begins to wonder: would it not be better, from the very beginning—and indeed at every moment—to learn about prayer itself? For prayer is the strength that makes it possible to live a life of piety, and it is the very path toward salvation.

With this thought, he turns to study. He reads about prayer, reflects on it, and searches through the writings of those who have taught about it. And he finds much wisdom: one speaks of the need for prayer, another of its power and benefits, another of the duty to pray. Still others speak of the diligence prayer requires, the attention of mind, the warmth of heart, the need for humility, contrition, reconciliation with others, and purity of thought.

All of this is good and inspiring. Yet he cannot help but ask: What is prayer itself? And how does one actually pray?

Strangely, though these questions are so basic and essential, clear and practical answers are rarely given. And so the seeker remains confused. From all his reading, he remembers mostly the outward expressions of prayer: attending church, making the sign of the cross, bowing to the ground, kneeling, chanting psalms, canons, akathists. These, while holy, are not the heart of prayer itself.

And indeed, this is how prayer is commonly understood by those who do not yet know the writings on inner prayer or the wisdom of the Holy Fathers.

At last, he discovers the *Philokalia*, a treasury in which twenty-five holy teachers reveal the art of true prayer of the heart. Here, at last, the veil begins to lift. He sees that real prayer is to hold the mind and memory steady in the remembrance of God—to walk always in His presence, to stir the heart to love Him by turning thoughts to Him, and to let the name of Jesus be carried on the breath and in the beating of the heart.

And so, prayer is not confined to times or places, nor to postures or rituals alone. It becomes a way of life: the continual calling on the most holy Name of Jesus, the Jesus Prayer, offered unceasingly, everywhere, in all things, and at all times.

These clear truths awaken the seeker’s understanding and open the path for him to learn how to pray rightly. He is eager to begin, and he sets out at once to put these instructions into practice. Yet even with such wisdom before him, he soon finds himself struggling. His prayer is inconsistent, and he falters often.

It is only when an experienced guide, using that same book—the *Philokalia*—steps in to help, that the seeker begins to see more deeply. The guide explains that the heart of the mystery lies not in lofty thoughts or special techniques, but in constancy—unceasing repetition of the prayer, no matter how weakly or imperfectly it begins. This steady rhythm of prayer is the only true path toward the fullness of inner prayer and the salvation of the soul.

Constancy becomes the foundation of everything else. As Saint Simeon the New Theologian declares, “The one who prays unceasingly has gathered everything good into this one work.”

To make this even clearer, the guide begins to unfold the teaching in full:

First of all, true faith is needed for the salvation of the soul. As Scripture says, *without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one without faith stands under judgment.*

And yet, in that same Scripture, it is written that a person cannot produce faith on their own—not even faith the size of a mustard seed. Faith is not born from our efforts, but is itself a gift of God, a grace bestowed by the Holy Spirit.

What then should a person do? How can we hold together our deep need for faith with our inability to create it on our own?

The answer is found in Scripture itself: *Ask, and you will receive.* Even the apostles, on their own, could not stir up perfect faith within themselves. So they turned to Jesus and prayed, “Lord, grant us faith.” Their example makes it clear: faith is received through prayer.

But faith alone is not enough. For the salvation of the soul, good works—acts of love and virtue—are also needed. As the Apostle James reminds us, *faith without works is dead.* And Jesus Himself said, *If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments: Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.* And this is not optional—for whoever fails in even one commandment is guilty of all.

Yet here lies the struggle. Paul, in his deep honesty, admits that though he longs to do good, he finds himself unable. *The law is spiritual, but I am weak and bound by sin. The good I want to do, I cannot carry out; and the evil I do not want to do, that I end up doing. In my heart I love God’s law, yet in my flesh I am captive to the law of sin.*

How then can anyone keep the commandments? How can one walk in God’s way if the will alone is not enough? Paul gives the answer: *you do not have because you do not ask.*

Our weakness is not final—it is only weakness when we do not pray. For Jesus Himself said, *Without Me, you can do nothing.* And again, *Abide in Me, and I in you. Whoever abides in Me will bear much fruit.*

To abide in Him is to remain in His presence—to walk with Him moment by moment—and to ask in His Name without ceasing. For He promised, *If you ask anything in My Name, I will do it.*

Thus it is through prayer that we gain the strength to live in good works. Even the Apostle Paul shows us this: he prayed three times to be freed from temptation; he bowed before the Father asking to be strengthened inwardly; and in the end, he taught that prayer must come first, and that one must pray about everything—unceasingly.

From this, it becomes clear: the salvation of the soul depends on prayer. Prayer is the root and the breath of faith, and through it every virtue takes form. In short, everything can be accomplished through prayer—and without it, no true Christian life is possible.

This is why only prayer is given the command to be constant. Each other virtue has its time, but of prayer it is said: *pray without ceasing.* We are called to pray always, everywhere, in every circumstance.

Yet true prayer is not merely words. It asks for a heart that is pure, a mind that is clear, a spirit that is attentive and aflame with love, filled with humility and awe. And here we must admit, if we are honest: how far we often are from such prayer. So often, we pray out of duty rather than delight, forcing ourselves rather than being carried by love.

Scripture itself tells us that on our own, we cannot clear the mind or purify the heart. *The thoughts of man are evil from his youth.* Only God can give a new heart and create a new spirit within us. Even the will to pray, and the act of praying itself, come from Him.

Paul himself confessed: *My spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.* And again he writes, *We do not know what we should pray for as we ought.*

From this we see: left to ourselves, we cannot even grasp the very essence of true prayer.

Faced with such helplessness, what remains within a person’s own will? What strength does one truly have to save the soul? He cannot bring about faith by himself, nor good works, nor even true prayer. What, then, is left? What power belongs to his free will so that he might not perish, but live?

Here is the mystery: since every action has its own essence, the Lord has kept the essence of prayer for Himself, giving it as a gift of grace when He wills. Yet, to show that we depend on Him entirely, He has left to us the *quantity* of prayer—the practice of praying unceasingly. He has commanded us to pray always, everywhere, and at all times. In this command is hidden the path: through constancy in prayer, the soul is led into true prayer, and with it comes faith, the keeping of God’s commandments, and salvation itself.

The Fathers of the Church speak clearly on this. Saint Macarius the Great says: *To pray in any manner, so long as it is constant, is within our power; but true prayer is a gift of grace.* Hesychius teaches that constancy in prayer becomes a habit, and habit turns into second nature—so much so that the heart cannot be cleansed apart from the continual calling on the Name of Jesus.

Callistus and Ignatius counsel that before any ascetic struggle or act of virtue, one should begin with unceasing prayer in the Name of Christ. For even an impure prayer, when offered with constancy, is purified by its very persistence. Blessed Diadochus adds that if one were to call on God’s Name continually, he would not fall into sin.

How wise and practical are these words of the Fathers! Their teaching is simple, flowing from their lived experience, and it shines like a lamp upon the way of the soul.

How different their words sound from the reasoning of mere moral philosophy! Human reason says: Do this or that; strengthen your will; fight for virtue; cleanse your thoughts of distraction and fill them with noble ideas; live well, and you will be respected, and your conscience will be at peace.

But alas—how often even our best efforts fall short! For without the constancy of prayer, and without the help of God that prayer calls down, all such striving remains powerless.

Let us listen again to the Fathers and see what they teach about the purification of the soul.

Saint John of the Ladder writes, *When the soul is darkened by unclean thoughts, strike your enemies with the Name of Jesus, repeating it constantly. You will find no stronger weapon in heaven or on earth.*

Saint Gregory of Sinai teaches, *Know that no man is able to master his own mind. But when unclean thoughts appear, call upon the Name of Jesus Christ with greater frequency, and the thoughts will quiet themselves.*

What a simple and mercifully accessible method this is—and how proven by experience! And how different it is from the advice of reason alone, which demands purity through sheer effort of will.

So then, from the lived teaching of the holy Fathers, we can reach this firm conclusion: the most direct, the most reliable, and the most accessible way toward salvation and perfection of soul is found in the *frequency* of prayer—the steady, unbroken rhythm of calling on the Lord, even if our prayer feels weak.

O Christian soul! If you do not yet feel within yourself the ability to worship God in spirit and in truth… if your heart has not yet tasted the warmth and sweetness of inward prayer—then still, do not despair. Offer what you *can*. Give to God what lies within your reach. Begin with your lips. Let them form the prayer, however simple, however small. Let them accustom themselves to the continual calling on the mighty Name of Jesus Christ.

This is not beyond anyone. It asks for no great strength, only persistence. And through it, the promise of Scripture comes alive: *Let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God—that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His Name.*

The constancy of prayer will eventually become a habit, a natural part of life. Over time, it shapes the mind and heart in the right way. Imagine if a person were to faithfully keep just this one commandment—praying without ceasing. In this single act, he would fulfill all the commandments.

If he called on the Name of Jesus constantly, in the secret place of his heart, at all times and through all activities—even at first without warmth or zeal, even by sheer effort of will—there would be no room for sinful pleasures. Every wandering or impure thought would meet resistance before it could take root, and no sinful act would seem appealing, as it might to an idle mind. Idle chatter would fade, and the grace contained in the Name of God, invoked continually, would quickly erase each transgression.

Through constant prayer, the soul is drawn away from sin and toward what is most important of all—union with God. This is why quantity matters so deeply in prayer. Unceasing prayer is the surest way to reach true, pure prayer. It is the most reliable path to prepare the heart, to achieve the goal of prayer, and to draw closer to salvation.

To deepen your understanding of the power and necessity of constant prayer, consider this: first, every stirring in your heart, every thought of prayer, comes from the Holy Spirit and the voice of your guardian angel. Second, the Name of Jesus itself, when called upon, carries its own living, active power. And third, do not be discouraged by the dryness or weakness of your prayers—patiently continue, trusting that the fruits of calling on God’s Name will come in their own time.

Do not heed the idle suggestions of the world, which claims that a single, simple, persistent prayer is too small or too long-winded to matter. The truth is, the power of God’s Name and your faithful repetition of it will bear fruit, in its own way, in its own time.

One spiritual writer expresses this beautifully: he says that many so-called wise people, who seek grandeur and act according to the proud reasoning of the world, look down on the simple, constant practice of prayer. They consider it insignificant, even trivial. But how mistaken they are! They forget what Jesus taught: *Unless you become like little children, you will by no means enter the Kingdom of God.*

They invent complicated methods and rely on reason, yet what does it really take to say with a sincere heart, *“Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on me”?* This simple, steady prayer is exactly what Christ praised. Even miracles were wrought through such brief but constant invocations of His Name.
