# Chapter 6

> *“Brother helped by brother is like a city, strong and tall; it is fortified as a firmly established kingdom.”
—PROV. 18:19*

**Pilgrim:** As I promised when I saw you yesterday, I brought along my esteemed traveling companion—the man whose bright conversation made the road more pleasant, and whom you said you wanted to meet.

**Starets:** I am very glad to see both of you, and I hope my honored guests share that joy. It is a blessing to hear of your experiences. These are my guests: a venerable skhimnik and a Reverend Father. Where two or three are gathered in the name of Jesus Christ, He promised to be present; now that five of us are gathered in His Name, His grace will surely be poured out even more abundantly.

Good friend, the story your traveling companion told me yesterday about your deep devotion to the Holy Gospel was remarkable and enlightening. I would be glad to hear how this devout mystery was revealed to you.

**Professor:** In His great mercy, the abundantly loving Lord—who desires that all be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth—revealed this knowledge to me in a wondrous way, without any human intervention. I was a professor at the Lyceum\* for five years, living a degraded life, swept away by empty secular philosophies rather than by Christ. I might have utterly perished if not for the steady, godly influence of my devout mother and my sister, a serious, unmarried young woman with whom I lived...

“One day, while walking along the main boulevard, I met an extraordinary young man. He told me he was French, well-educated, and had just arrived from Paris in search of a tutoring position. I was impressed by his refinement and his high level of learning. Since he was new in town, I invited him to my home, and we quickly became friends.

For about two months, he often visited me, and sometimes we went out together—seeking amusements and visiting places that, as you can imagine, were not known for their moral atmosphere.

One day, he invited me to join him at such a place, trying to entice me by describing its “special attractions.” But in the middle of his lively description, he suddenly stopped and asked if we could leave my study, where we were sitting, and go to the drawing room.

This struck me as odd. I told him I had noticed before that he seemed reluctant to stay in my study, and I asked him why. I also wanted to keep him there, since the drawing room was next to my mother’s and sister’s rooms, and it would have been inappropriate to have such a conversation within earshot of them.

He tried to offer various excuses, until at last he admitted honestly: “Among the other books on your shelf, I see a New Testament. I respect it so much that I find it difficult to speak of immoral things in its presence. Please, take it out of here, and then we can talk freely.”

Foolishly, I laughed and said, “You should have told me sooner!” I took the New Testament from the shelf, handed it to him, and added, “Here, you put it in the other room.”

The moment the Holy Book touched his hands, he began to tremble violently—and in an instant, he vanished.

I was struck with such horror that I collapsed to the floor in a dead faint. The servants, hearing the commotion, rushed in and tried for half an hour to revive me. When at last I regained consciousness, I was seized with an indescribable fear. My whole body trembled, my hands and feet were numb, and I could not move them. A doctor was called, and he declared that I was suffering from paralysis brought on by a sudden and powerful shock.

“For an entire year after this strange incident—and despite the devoted care of many skilled physicians—I lay bedridden, with no relief in sight. In time, I was forced to resign from my teaching post. My dear, elderly mother passed away during this period, and my sister resolved to enter a monastery. All these sorrows only deepened the weight of my illness.

The only light in those dark days was the New Testament. From the very first moments of my sickness, it had never left my hands. It became both my comfort and my constant reminder of that extraordinary event.

One day, a hermit whom I had never met before appeared at my door, collecting alms for his cloister. He spoke to me gently but firmly, urging me not to rely solely on medicine—“for medicines have no power without the help of God,” he said. “Ask God, and pray diligently, for prayer is the strongest remedy for every illness, both of body and of soul.”

I protested in confusion: “But how can I pray in this state? I can’t even make a single prostration or raise my hand to bless myself with the sign of the cross!”

“At least try to pray somehow,” he replied simply. He offered no further explanation, and soon departed.

Yet his words lingered. My mind began to dwell on prayer—its meaning, its power, its fruits—and I recalled, almost as if by providence, the theology lectures I had once heard as a student. The memory of those spiritual truths warmed my heart. At once, I felt a faint easing of my illness.

The New Testament lay at my side, and since that miraculous encounter I had held a firm faith in its words. I remembered, too, that all those lectures I had heard about prayer were drawn entirely from its pages. It seemed clear to me that the best way to learn about prayer—and about Christian piety itself—was to go straight to the source.

So I began to read the New Testament slowly, carefully, attentively—turning it into a deep and abundant spring from which I drew understanding of the full path to salvation and the true way of interior prayer. I marked every passage that touched on the subject. From that day forward, I have tried to study these divine teachings regularly and to put them into practice as best I can, though not without struggle.

And as I did so, my illness gradually lessened—until at last, as you see now, I was completely restored. Alone in the world, I resolved that in gratitude for God’s fatherly mercy—for His healing and His guidance—I would follow my sister’s example and the call of my own soul. I would consecrate myself to an ascetic life, so that, free from worldly hindrance, I might seek and embrace those sweet words of eternal life which the Scriptures had so generously revealed to me.”

“So now,” the professor continued, “I am making my way toward the secluded skete at the Solovets Monastery by the White Sea—the one called Anzerskiy—which I have heard from a most trustworthy source is perfectly suited for the contemplative life.

I’ll tell you frankly: While the holy New Testament has been my constant comfort on the road, illuminating my still-unripe mind and even warming my cold heart, I cannot hide from you the truth of my weakness. I am afraid—afraid because my heart is both frail and damaged, and because the Gospel sets before us such great demands for doing good works and attaining salvation. It calls for complete self-denial, for tireless spiritual struggle, for a humility deeper than I can yet fathom. And so, I stand between despair and hope… and I do not know what will become of me.”

The skhimnik looked at him earnestly and replied,

“After such a clear and miraculous sign of God’s mercy toward you—and with your level of learning—it is not only wrong but utterly inexcusable for you to give in to despair, or even allow the faintest shadow of doubt to enter your heart about God’s providence and help!

Do you know what the holy ‘Golden-Mouth’—St. John Chrysostom, enlightened by God—teaches about this? He says: *‘No one should ever despair, nor imagine the Gospel commandments to be unattainable or impossible to fulfill! For when God appointed the path for man’s salvation, He did not set down commandments so hard that man would be driven to sin. No! Rather, they were given so that, through their holiness and their life-giving necessity, we might be blessed both in this present life and in eternity.’*”

The skhimnik nodded, his eyes warm but serious.

“Of course,” he said, “to our fallen nature, the steadfast and constant keeping of God’s commandments feels impossibly hard, and so salvation itself may seem out of reach. But the same divine Word that gave us these commandments also gave us the means—not only to fulfill them with ease, but to find consolation in fulfilling them.

“If at first this truth is hidden from you, that is no accident. It is meant to lead the beginner into deeper humility, and to draw him more closely to God, teaching him that his safest refuge is not in his own strength, but in prayer—in calling on His Fatherly help. That is where the mystery of salvation lies—not in trusting our own willpower, but in relying entirely on Him.”

The pilgrim’s face lit up with longing.

“Weak and powerless as I am,” he said, “how I wish I could know this mystery well enough to put it to use—to stir my lazy soul, even a little, toward the glory of God and my salvation!”

The skhimnik smiled gently.

“But you do know it, dear brother,” he replied. “You’ve learned it already from your *Philokalia*. It is the mystery of unceasing prayer—that very prayer you have come to know so well, that you practice so fervently, and that you find so much comfort in.”

The pilgrim bowed his head.

“Reverend Father,” he said with emotion, “for the love of God, let me hear it from your own lips. Speak to me of this mystery of salvation and of this holy prayer, which more than anything else I hunger to hear about, and love to read of—for it strengthens and comforts my poor, sinful soul.”
