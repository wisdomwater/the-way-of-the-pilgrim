# Foreword

When I began looking for a book from the Orthodox Christian tradition, *The Way of the Pilgrim* was recommended to me. To deepen my own understanding, I took an existing translation from the Malankara Library and carefully reformulated the wording.

What I discovered was a treasure: the simple, steady rhythm of the Jesus Prayer—*“Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me.”* The emphasis on unceasing repetition was something new for me. It was never part of the faith tradition of my youth. Yet as I opened myself to it, I found it to be a welcome companion on the journey of prayer.

Now, when I lie awake at night, I often whisper these words. Not because I believe I am evil, unworthy, or trying to appease God, but because life can feel isolating and lonely. In those moments, the presence of the living Christ—called upon with this short prayer—becomes a balm to the soul.

My hope is that this little book nourishes you as it has nourished me. May these pages open a path of quiet prayer, steady presence, and simple faith. And may you discover, in your own pilgrimage of life, that Christ is always closer than your breath.

*Many blessings on the road ahead.*

—Michael
